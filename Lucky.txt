Konata Izumi : Well, let's get going. 	(0:00:00.87)
Miyuki Takara : Let's go! 	(0:00:02.37)
Kagami Hiiragi : Stop messing around and start! 	(0:00:03.95)
EXTRA : On your mark! 	(0:01:31.98)
EXTRA : Get set! 	(0:01:33.69)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You've done it again, Kona-chan. 	(0:01:44.57)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That was amazing. 	(0:01:45.83)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : How come you aren't on any sports teams... 	(0:01:47.70)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...when you're so athletic? 	(0:01:49.54)
Konata Izumi : 'Cause if I join a team... 	(0:01:52.17)
Konata Izumi : ...I'll miss my prime time anime. 	(0:01:54.75)
Konata Izumi : Say, Tsukasa. 	(0:02:07.35)
Konata Izumi : Which end of a choco-cornet do you start from? 	(0:02:08.56)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : The head, I suppose. 	(0:02:12.31)
Konata Izumi : I see. 	(0:02:14.19)
Konata Izumi : By the way... 	(0:02:16.13)
Konata Izumi : Which side's the head? 	(0:02:17.13)
Konata Izumi : The fat end or the thin end? 	(0:02:18.34)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I would guess the thin end. 	(0:02:21.07)
Konata Izumi : Oh. 	(0:02:24.79)
Konata Izumi : I thought it was the fat end. 	(0:02:25.83)
Konata Izumi : But why would the thin end be the head? 	(0:02:29.37)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Well, doesn't it look like a seashell? 	(0:02:31.50)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Why did you think it was the fat end, Kona-chan? 	(0:02:33.75)
Konata Izumi : 'Cause, you know... 	(0:02:36.01)
Konata Izumi : It looks like a caterpillar? 	(0:02:36.97)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : A caterpillar? 	(0:02:38.90)
Konata Izumi : But I guess it works better if you picture a seashell. 	(0:02:39.97)
Miyuki Takara : U-Um... 	(0:02:59.40)
Miyuki Takara : You could cut off the thin end... 	(0:03:01.40)
Miyuki Takara : ...and eat it with the excess chocolate. 	(0:03:03.16)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Now I get it. 	(0:03:07.07)
Konata Izumi : Good thinking, Miyuki-san. 	(0:03:12.08)
Konata Izumi : You're so smart. 	(0:03:13.67)
Miyuki Takara : Not at all. 	(0:03:14.94)
Miyuki Takara : Everyone has their own approach to eating. 	(0:03:15.75)
Konata Izumi : How do you eat cream puffs? 	(0:03:18.44)
Miyuki Takara : Cream puffs, you ask? 	(0:03:21.09)
Miyuki Takara : Well... 	(0:03:22.82)
Miyuki Takara : I start by splitting it in half... 	(0:03:23.99)
Miyuki Takara : ...and eating the lid after dipping it in the cream from the bottom... 	(0:03:26.39)
Miyuki Takara : And then I eat the bottom half. 	(0:03:29.64)
Miyuki Takara : This way, I don't have to worry about any cream spilling out... 	(0:03:33.40)
Miyuki Takara : ...while maintaining a balance between cream and puff. 	(0:03:36.69)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What about the ones that have both custard and cream inside? 	(0:03:41.65)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : How do you eat those? 	(0:03:45.33)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Do you mix them up? 	(0:03:47.08)
Miyuki Takara : No. 	(0:03:48.08)
Miyuki Takara : I wouldn't do such a thing. 	(0:03:48.70)
Miyuki Takara : But how would you mix them? 	(0:03:51.32)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Just asking. 	(0:03:53.79)
Konata Izumi : When do you eat the strawberry on a strawberry shortcake... 	(0:03:55.15)
Konata Izumi : ...or the chestnut on top of a Mont Blanc? 	(0:03:57.25)
Miyuki Takara : Let's see... 	(0:03:59.51)
Miyuki Takara : There are also strawberries tucked between layers of sponge cake. 	(0:04:01.18)
Miyuki Takara : I follow a normal distribution of strawberry, cream, and cake as I eat. 	(0:04:05.89)
Miyuki Takara : So there isn't a set time for eating the strawberry. 	(0:04:11.85)
Konata Izumi : You really know your stuff. 	(0:04:16.56)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I always save the strawberry for last. 	(0:04:18.39)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : But then I get full sometimes... 	(0:04:21.95)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...so I end up not eating it... 	(0:04:24.45)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...or someone in my family takes it. 	(0:04:25.99)
Konata Izumi : Your favorites gotta come first. 	(0:04:27.95)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Actually, I don't think I've ever seen anyone take a strawberry from onee-chan. 	(0:04:31.08)
Konata Izumi : That's Kagami for you. 	(0:04:35.13)
Konata Izumi : Doesn't miss a step. 	(0:04:36.08)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Are you able to eat the last bite of a popsicle without dropping it? 	(0:04:37.29)
Miyuki Takara : Dropping it? 	(0:04:41.72)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : If you aren't careful... 	(0:04:43.13)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...you drop the last bit, right? 	(0:04:46.59)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What do you do, Kona-chan? 	(0:04:49.09)
Konata Izumi : Suck it down to nothing. 	(0:04:50.56)
Miyuki Takara : You could rotate the popsicle as you eat. 	(0:04:53.05)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That's a good idea. 	(0:04:56.31)
Miyuki Takara : I'm not very fond of ice cream cones. 	(0:04:57.56)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Why? 	(0:05:01.14)
Miyuki Takara : I can't stand it when only the cone is left. 	(0:05:03.06)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That's right. 	(0:05:06.07)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You always end up with some cone left. 	(0:05:07.16)
Konata Izumi : I push the ice cream into the cone as I eat. 	(0:05:09.37)
Miyuki Takara : How do you push the ice cream? 	(0:05:14.82)
Konata Izumi : I do a little ~gui gui~ action as I eat. 	(0:05:16.96)
Miyuki Takara : ~gui gui~, is it? 	(0:05:19.66)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Yuki-chan prioritizes balance, right? 	(0:05:21.75)
Miyuki Takara : That's right. 	(0:05:24.05)
Konata Izumi : Then what do you do with curry rice? 	(0:05:25.20)
Konata Izumi : Do you mix the sauce with the rice? 	(0:05:27.30)
Miyuki Takara : No. 	(0:05:29.34)
Miyuki Takara : I don't mix them... 	(0:05:30.10)
Miyuki Takara : ...but I make sure that they're equally proportioned. 	(0:05:31.85)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I mix mine up. 	(0:05:33.80)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What about you, Kona-chan? 	(0:05:35.52)
Konata Izumi : Depends on the curry. 	(0:05:36.56)
Konata Izumi : If there's any sauce or raw egg in it... 	(0:05:37.98)
Konata Izumi : ...I guess I'll sometimes mix it. 	(0:05:40.50)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Sauce in curry? 	(0:05:42.02)
Konata Izumi : It's delicious. 	(0:05:43.73)
Miyuki Takara : Do you also put sauce on your fried eggs? 	(0:05:44.78)
Konata Izumi : I put soy sauce on fried eggs. 	(0:05:47.61)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I use mayonnaise. 	(0:05:50.15)
Miyuki Takara : Not on your boiled eggs but on your fried eggs? 	(0:05:52.12)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You see, mayonnaise... 	(0:05:55.72)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...goes well with most egg dishes. 	(0:05:56.98)
Konata Izumi : Do you put it on your curry? 	(0:05:58.88)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It's a must on white rice. 	(0:06:01.54)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : But the sweetness also goes well with udons. 	(0:06:03.63)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It's also good with parent-child bowls. 	(0:06:06.59)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You know how eggs and chicken meat are child and parent. 	(0:06:08.17)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : So once I add mayonnaise, which is made from eggs... 	(0:06:10.66)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...I call it an expanded family bowl. 	(0:06:14.12)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Also... 	(0:06:18.18)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I usually can't stand natto... 	(0:06:19.06)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...but I can eat it after I add mayonnaise. 	(0:06:20.65)
Konata Izumi : Can't imagine it. 	(0:06:23.18)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : But... 	(0:06:24.81)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...putting mayonnaise on soft-boiled eggs might be best. 	(0:06:25.61)
Konata Izumi : The fried eggs at my house are also half-done. 	(0:06:29.78)
Konata Izumi : It's how my otou-san likes them. 	(0:06:33.33)
Konata Izumi : He likes to suck out the yolk. 	(0:06:35.33)
Konata Izumi : And if it's overcooked, he can't suck the yolk. 	(0:06:38.87)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : How do you eat yakitori? 	(0:06:42.75)
Konata Izumi : What do you mean how? 	(0:06:44.67)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Do you eat it right off the skewer? 	(0:06:45.84)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Or do you use chopsticks to take it off? 	(0:06:47.47)
Miyuki Takara : Let's see... 	(0:06:49.68)
Miyuki Takara : If I'm eating one by myself, I'll leave it on the skewer. 	(0:06:51.14)
Miyuki Takara : But if I'm with other people, I'll take it off. 	(0:06:54.27)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Yeah, yeah. 	(0:06:56.68)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Isn't it a little awkward when there's only one left? 	(0:06:57.92)
Miyuki Takara : I can't bring myself to take the last one. 	(0:07:01.43)
Konata Izumi : As time goes by without anyone eating it... 	(0:07:04.07)
Konata Izumi : It starts getting dry... 	(0:07:07.90)
Konata Izumi : ...and looking anything but appetizing... 	(0:07:09.39)
Konata Izumi : ...and nobody really wants it anymore... 	(0:07:11.10)
Konata Izumi : ...but when the server takes it, you go... 	(0:07:12.81)
Konata Izumi : "Wait, we're not done with that yet." 	(0:07:13.89)
Konata Izumi : ...kinda on reflex. 	(0:07:15.79)
Konata Izumi : But then you end up leaving without eating it. 	(0:07:17.66)
Miyuki Takara : Such a waste. 	(0:07:20.46)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I feel sorry for it. 	(0:07:22.02)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : And with yakiniku... 	(0:07:24.91)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...I feel sorry for the meat that's all charred and stuck to the grill. 	(0:07:26.21)
Miyuki Takara : You have to eat while you're grilling and chatting... 	(0:07:29.88)
Miyuki Takara : ...so it's a busy ordeal. 	(0:07:33.39)
Konata Izumi : It's even worse with onion beef tongue slices since they're done in no time. 	(0:07:35.22)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You're right. 	(0:07:38.98)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : They're already done after only one flip. 	(0:07:40.31)
Konata Izumi : Flip? 	(0:07:43.77)
Konata Izumi : Onion beef tongue slices? 	(0:07:45.73)
Konata Izumi : You shouldn't flip those over! 	(0:07:47.25)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Really? 	(0:07:50.48)
Konata Izumi : If you flip them over... 	(0:07:51.44)
Konata Izumi : ...the onions on top will fall off. 	(0:07:52.82)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Oh, yeah. 	(0:07:55.69)
Konata Izumi : You don't need to flip it over. They'll finish cooking from roasting just one side. 	(0:07:56.74)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I see... 	(0:08:01.54)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I'll do that from now on. 	(0:08:02.58)
Konata Izumi : You should never flip them over. 	(0:08:04.25)
Miyuki Takara : Is that so? 	(0:08:06.55)
Konata Izumi : By the way, between the fat or thin end, which is the head of a choco-cornet? 	(0:08:13.13)
Kagami Hiiragi : Super bad boy. 	(0:08:17.97)
Kagami Hiiragi : There've been a bunch of kidnapping cases recently. 	(0:08:20.14)
Kagami Hiiragi : Guys forcing girls to address them as "Master" and stuff. 	(0:08:22.77)
Konata Izumi : Isn't that less an issue of morals... 	(0:08:27.39)
Konata Izumi : ...and more an issue of playing too many dating sims and adult games? 	(0:08:29.51)
Konata Izumi : It's a commonly used scenario. 	(0:08:32.68)
Kagami Hiiragi : Aren't you talking about yourself?! 	(0:08:34.35)
Kagami Hiiragi : Er, wait a second. 	(0:08:38.38)
Kagami Hiiragi : Why are you so well versed in the adult game scenarios... 	(0:08:39.39)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...Miss High School Second-year? 	(0:08:41.44)
Konata Izumi : Your grades are always so good. 	(0:08:48.25)
Konata Izumi : Don't you have any faults, Miyuki-san? 	(0:08:52.33)
Miyuki Takara : I'm ashamed to say... 	(0:08:55.09)
Miyuki Takara : ...that I have a tendency to brood over things... 	(0:08:56.72)
Miyuki Takara : ...or space out. 	(0:08:59.25)
Miyuki Takara : I've cut my finger while using a slicer. 	(0:09:01.51)
Miyuki Takara : Ow! 	(0:09:03.93)
Miyuki Takara : And tripped over myself while in a hurry. 	(0:09:04.68)
Miyuki Takara : And gotten my bag stuck in the door on a train. 	(0:09:08.20)
Konata Izumi : Miyuki-san. 	(0:09:12.74)
Konata Izumi : Those aren't faults, but elements of moe. 	(0:09:13.99)
Miyuki Takara : Moe? 	(0:09:17.90)
Konata Izumi : The clumsy factor. 	(0:09:18.58)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What was going on inside Kona-chan's head during all that?! 	(0:09:19.83)
Konata Izumi : Miyuki-san, why do you wear glasses when you're actually attractive? 	(0:09:23.32)
Konata Izumi : You can only target a niche audience. 	(0:09:26.38)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Target's a little... 	(0:09:28.59)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Setting aside the issue of popularity... 	(0:09:30.16)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...why don't you wear contacts? 	(0:09:32.59)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I heard that glasses make your vision worse. 	(0:09:34.30)
Miyuki Takara : Um... 	(0:09:37.01)
Miyuki Takara : I'm ashamed to be saying this in high school... 	(0:09:37.97)
Miyuki Takara : B-But... 	(0:09:41.24)
Miyuki Takara : I'm... 	(0:09:42.50)
Miyuki Takara : Scared! 	(0:09:43.87)
Miyuki Takara : Of contacts! 	(0:09:45.10)
Miyuki Takara : Or to be specific... 	(0:09:46.56)
Miyuki Takara : ...putting things in my eyes. 	(0:09:47.81)
Miyuki Takara : I can never open my eyes when I'm underwater. 	(0:09:50.19)
Konata Izumi : Damn! 	(0:09:52.78)
Konata Izumi : She's cute to the core! 	(0:09:53.61)
Konata Izumi : Must be innate. 	(0:09:55.36)
Konata Izumi : Isn't that Miyuki-san? 	(0:09:57.34)
Konata Izumi : Is she here for an eye examination? 	(0:10:00.15)
Konata Izumi : To get contacts? 	(0:10:01.80)
Konata Izumi : Miyuki-san's probably better off this way forever. 	(0:10:05.95)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That looked painful... 	(0:10:09.08)
Konata Izumi : She's a living monument. 	(0:10:10.19)
Konata Izumi : Kagami's at home with a cold? 	(0:10:14.29)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : For now it looks like she doesn't have the flu though. 	(0:10:17.04)
Konata Izumi : I'm stupid, so I don't have to worry about getting the flu. 	(0:10:20.18)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I've heard that applies to colds... 	(0:10:24.72)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...but it also applies to the flu? 	(0:10:26.23)
Konata Izumi : There's a difference between a cold and the flu? 	(0:10:30.77)
Konata Izumi : I thought the flu was like a super cold. 	(0:10:33.03)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I-I think they're different... 	(0:10:35.28)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : But now I'm not sure anymore... 	(0:10:37.86)
Miyuki Takara : The difference between the flu and a cold? 	(0:10:41.94)
Miyuki Takara : Well... 	(0:10:45.53)
Miyuki Takara : The flu is caused by a virus. 	(0:10:47.20)
Miyuki Takara : The symptoms are a fever and aching throughout the body. 	(0:10:49.71)
Miyuki Takara : And there is a risk of complications. 	(0:10:53.00)
Miyuki Takara : On the other hand... 	(0:10:55.88)
Miyuki Takara : ...the symptoms of a cold are a sore throat and runny nose... 	(0:10:56.67)
Miyuki Takara : ...and the fever doesn't run as high. 	(0:10:59.26)
Miyuki Takara : And there are a number of other minute differences. 	(0:11:01.39)
Miyuki Takara : Which is why... 	(0:11:05.47)
Miyuki Takara : ...they are different illnesses. 	(0:11:06.39)
Konata Izumi : I see... 	(0:11:09.22)
Miyuki Takara : H-However... 	(0:11:11.45)
Miyuki Takara : Well, they share many similarities... 	(0:11:12.89)
Miyuki Takara : ...so you could possibly say that the flu is an upgraded version of a cold... 	(0:11:15.40)
Konata Izumi : I see! 	(0:11:19.28)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Kona-chan. 	(0:11:22.40)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What's with the pensive face? 	(0:11:22.95)
Konata Izumi : Oh, nothing big but... 	(0:11:25.29)
Konata Izumi : ...I was concerned over our conversation this morning. 	(0:11:27.16)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : About a cold and the flu? 	(0:11:29.78)
Konata Izumi : You didn't disagree when I said I was dumb. 	(0:11:31.71)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : N-No! 	(0:11:35.34)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It's not like that! 	(0:11:36.17)
Miki Hiiragi : Konata-chan. 	(0:11:42.88)
Miki Hiiragi : Welcome. 	(0:11:44.01)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : She's here to visit onee-chan. 	(0:11:44.97)
Miki Hiiragi : Thank you for visiting. 	(0:11:47.84)
Konata Izumi : It's nothing. 	(0:11:49.31)
Konata Izumi : Sorry to intrude. 	(0:11:49.94)
Konata Izumi : Kagami actually looks pretty cute when she's asleep. 	(0:11:56.39)
Kagami Hiiragi : What is it?! 	(0:11:59.08)
Kagami Hiiragi : Why are you here?! 	(0:11:59.72)
Konata Izumi : She's up. She's up. 	(0:12:00.33)
Kagami Hiiragi : Get out! 	(0:12:00.80)
Kagami Hiiragi : Visiting? 	(0:12:02.40)
Kagami Hiiragi : You? 	(0:12:03.20)
Kagami Hiiragi : For my sake? 	(0:12:04.03)
Konata Izumi : That's right. 	(0:12:05.78)
Kagami Hiiragi : B-But I don't want you to catch the flu from me. 	(0:12:06.70)
Kagami Hiiragi : I appreciate the thought though. 	(0:12:08.87)
Kagami Hiiragi : Hah. 	(0:12:10.95)
Kagami Hiiragi : You know you're happy about it. 	(0:12:11.58)
Kagami Hiiragi : Is she worried about me... 	(0:12:13.38)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...because of the new virus going around? 	(0:12:15.54)
Kagami Hiiragi : I figured she only ever had games and anime on her mind. 	(0:12:17.76)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'm a little touched. 	(0:12:21.68)
Konata Izumi : Well... 	(0:12:25.09)
Konata Izumi : I wanted to see your homework from the other day. 	(0:12:25.60)
Konata Izumi : And you showed me a really cute sleeping face... 	(0:12:28.50)
Konata Izumi : ...so don't sweat it. 	(0:12:30.41)
Kagami Hiiragi : Go home! 	(0:12:31.68)
Miki Hiiragi : Kagami! 	(0:12:34.01)
Miki Hiiragi : Miyuki-chan's here to visit you! 	(0:12:35.06)
Kagami Hiiragi : Okay! 	(0:12:38.27)
Miyuki Takara : I'm sorry to intrude. 	(0:12:39.44)
Kagami Hiiragi : Sorry you had to come on a day off. 	(0:12:41.27)
Miyuki Takara : Is it all right for you to be up? 	(0:12:43.11)
Miyuki Takara : This is a little something. 	(0:12:45.44)
Kagami Hiiragi : Thanks. 	(0:12:45.75)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'm a lot better now. 	(0:12:46.86)
Kagami Hiiragi : My fever went down after I took some medicine. 	(0:12:48.54)
Miyuki Takara : Here. 	(0:12:50.41)
Kagami Hiiragi : Flowers and fruits! I'm overjoyed! 	(0:12:51.41)
Kagami Hiiragi : Have a seat. 	(0:12:53.91)
Miyuki Takara : Thank you very much. 	(0:12:54.96)
Miyuki Takara : I intended to visit earlier with Izumi-san and everyone... 	(0:12:56.70)
Miyuki Takara : ...but my schedule hasn't been very forgiving. 	(0:13:00.55)
Kagami Hiiragi : It's okay. 	(0:13:03.22)
Miyuki Takara : I brought some materials from the student council meeting. 	(0:13:04.84)
Kagami Hiiragi : Thanks! 	(0:13:08.35)
Miyuki Takara : If you could take a quick glance without straining yourself... 	(0:13:09.93)
Miyuki Takara : Also, here are the budgets for each club. 	(0:13:14.85)
Miyuki Takara : And what else was there... 	(0:13:18.19)
Miyuki Takara : Um... 	(0:13:20.86)
Miyuki Takara : If I'm tiring you out... 	(0:13:22.35)
Miyuki Takara : ...I'll leave. 	(0:13:24.36)
Kagami Hiiragi : This is how a visit's supposed to be! 	(0:13:26.15)
Miyuki Takara : D-Did something happen? 	(0:13:28.28)
Kagami Hiiragi : Actually, Konata showed up yesterday... 	(0:13:30.70)
Kagami Hiiragi : It was like, good grief. 	(0:13:34.62)
Miyuki Takara : That may just be how Izumi-san expresses herself. 	(0:13:36.25)
Miyuki Takara : The homework may have been an attempt at humor... 	(0:13:40.71)
Miyuki Takara : ...in order to cheer you up. 	(0:13:42.97)
Miyuki Takara : And perhaps she saw how your face looked while you were sleeping... 	(0:13:46.26)
Miyuki Takara : ...because she didn't want to wake you up. 	(0:13:50.01)
Kagami Hiiragi : Is this woman a saint?! 	(0:13:52.18)
Kagami Hiiragi : That would've never occurred to me. 	(0:13:54.14)
Miyuki Takara : Come to think of it... 	(0:13:56.10)
Miyuki Takara : Is Tsukasa-san not here today? 	(0:13:57.27)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Good morning. 	(0:14:00.39)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Onee-chan, are you feeling any better? 	(0:14:02.44)
Kagami Hiiragi : As you can see... 	(0:14:09.11)
Kagami Hiiragi : She's more laid-back than the person who's sick. 	(0:14:10.16)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : U-Um... 	(0:14:13.70)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I'm not like this every morning... 	(0:14:15.04)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Just that I haven't really adjusted to daylight savings... 	(0:14:17.08)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It's a little late, but welcome. 	(0:14:20.62)
Miyuki Takara : I completely understand. 	(0:14:22.66)
Miyuki Takara : I've been having a hard time waking up as well. 	(0:14:24.05)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Th-That's right. 	(0:14:26.68)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You get so sleepy these days. 	(0:14:28.30)
Miyuki Takara : Indeed. 	(0:14:29.89)
Miyuki Takara : And it's especially warm today. 	(0:14:31.35)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That's the truth! 	(0:14:34.18)
Miyuki Takara : It can't be helped. 	(0:14:35.10)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : And you know how our last day off was also warm? 	(0:14:36.68)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : When I woke up, it was already evening. 	(0:14:40.14)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I spent most of the time sleeping. 	(0:14:43.03)
Miyuki Takara : It's good to rest when you have a day off. 	(0:14:45.24)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : So I ended up wearing my pajamas the whole day. 	(0:14:48.03)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I guess I still am. 	(0:14:51.61)
Miyuki Takara : Those are pajamas? 	(0:14:53.74)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That's right. 	(0:14:56.78)
Miyuki Takara : They're quite adorable. 	(0:14:57.87)
Miyuki Takara : I can't tell that they're pajamas. 	(0:14:59.58)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Really? 	(0:15:01.21)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I wonder if I can just stay in them. 	(0:15:02.83)
Miyuki Takara : You could walk outside in them. 	(0:15:05.17)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Could I go into a convenience store in these? 	(0:15:07.19)
Kagami Hiiragi : It's like an endless loop of dumb and dumber! 	(0:15:08.21)
Miyuki Takara : Nobody would blink an eye. 	(0:15:09.20)
Kagami Hiiragi : It's gone up a little... 	(0:15:12.59)
Kagami Hiiragi : No. 	(0:15:15.38)
Kagami Hiiragi : That might not be the case. 	(0:15:16.06)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'm wearing a wired bra with extra padding... 	(0:15:17.14)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...which means extra weight. 	(0:15:20.10)
Kagami Hiiragi : That has to be it. 	(0:15:21.73)
Kagami Hiiragi : I wonder how many grams that adds. 	(0:15:22.69)
Kagami Hiiragi : Once you subtract that... 	(0:15:24.78)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It's over... 	(0:15:29.11)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I totally screwed up. 	(0:15:30.94)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I forgot we had examinations today... 	(0:15:32.26)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...so I wore my character print underwear. 	(0:15:34.10)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I'm so embarrassed! 	(0:15:36.79)
Konata Izumi : I haven't grown at all... 	(0:15:39.91)
Kagami Hiiragi : Damn it! 	(0:15:42.67)
Kagami Hiiragi : You get to look all happy by yourself! 	(0:15:43.46)
Kagami Hiiragi : Yo. 	(0:15:46.39)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'm here. 	(0:15:47.59)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Ah, onee-chan. 	(0:15:48.46)
Konata Izumi : I was wondering. 	(0:15:49.72)
Konata Izumi : Kagami comes here a lot. 	(0:15:51.80)
Konata Izumi : Do you have no friends in your class? 	(0:15:54.24)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't put me on your level. 	(0:15:56.25)
Kagami Hiiragi : Are you trying to pick a fight? 	(0:15:57.89)
Konata Izumi : Oh. 	(0:15:59.18)
Konata Izumi : I thought you were being ostracized or something. 	(0:15:59.89)
Kagami Hiiragi : Worry less about me... 	(0:16:01.52)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...and more about your lack of a social life. 	(0:16:02.61)
Konata Izumi : You don't have to worry about that. 	(0:16:05.48)
Konata Izumi : Believe it or not, I have around a hundred friends. 	(0:16:07.53)
Konata Izumi : And I'm pretty good at social dealings. 	(0:16:10.45)
Konata Izumi : And I'm in a party every night. 	(0:16:13.70)
Konata Izumi : My comrades and I strive to recover the light stolen from the crystals... 	(0:16:16.36)
Konata Izumi : ...to save the world from oblivion... 	(0:16:19.20)
Konata Izumi : ...and rescue kidnapped princesses... 	(0:16:21.17)
Kagami Hiiragi : Aren't you talking about a game?! 	(0:16:22.08)
Kagami Hiiragi : I haven't seen that person in a while. 	(0:16:24.02)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Who? 	(0:16:26.32)
Kagami Hiiragi : She's probably talking about some friend from a game. 	(0:16:26.98)
Konata Izumi : He plays a warrior. 	(0:16:30.15)
Konata Izumi : He went somewhere with a lot of monsters to train his battle skills, and I haven't seen him since. 	(0:16:31.91)
Konata Izumi : I heard from someone else... 	(0:16:39.43)
Konata Izumi : ...that he was lying low in the sewers. 	(0:16:41.10)
Konata Izumi : I wonder if he's okay. 	(0:16:43.69)
Konata Izumi : Everyone's worried since he hasn't come out. 	(0:16:45.06)
Kagami Hiiragi : He isolated himself in the game? 	(0:16:48.32)
Konata Izumi : I don't know the details... 	(0:16:50.24)
Konata Izumi : ...but his log-in info implies that he's been online the whole time. 	(0:16:51.95)
Kagami Hiiragi : So he's isolated in both the real and virtual world?! 	(0:16:55.91)
Konata Izumi : Well, it's the same person in both cases. 	(0:16:57.93)
Kagami Hiiragi : That's right... 	(0:17:00.49)
Kagami Hiiragi : How did you two become friends? 	(0:17:01.37)
Konata Izumi : A huge fishy-looking foreigner was about to take Tsukasa away... 	(0:17:04.87)
Konata Izumi : ...when I happened to show up. 	(0:17:09.46)
Konata Izumi : Using my special fists of fury... 	(0:17:11.80)
Konata Izumi : ...and beautiful hurricane kick... 	(0:17:13.30)
Konata Izumi : ...I saved her. 	(0:17:15.43)
Kagami Hiiragi : Why do we always end up talking about games? 	(0:17:16.76)
Konata Izumi : Well, that's what happens when you run into an experienced fighter. 	(0:17:19.50)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'm not sure you should've resorted to violence so quickly... 	(0:17:23.31)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...but you did a good thing. 	(0:17:25.56)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : The foreigner was actually just asking me for directions... 	(0:17:26.97)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...but I was having a hard time understanding him when Kona-chan showed up... 	(0:17:30.57)
Kagami Hiiragi : Hey! 	(0:17:33.61)
Kagami Hiiragi : You were totally at fault there! 	(0:17:34.16)
Kagami Hiiragi : And why do you look so proud about it?! 	(0:17:35.16)
Konata Izumi : It's that time of year again... 	(0:17:37.07)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Is something going to happen? 	(0:17:40.74)
Konata Izumi : No. 	(0:17:42.12)
Konata Izumi : I was thinking that pro baseball season had started. 	(0:17:42.75)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Kona-chan you don't like watching sports? 	(0:17:45.21)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You're really athletic... 	(0:17:48.63)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...so I thought you might enjoy it. 	(0:17:50.46)
Konata Izumi : Because if the game goes into extra innings... 	(0:17:52.59)
Konata Izumi : ...the schedule for new anime gets all messed up. 	(0:17:55.22)
Konata Izumi : Sometimes, the show gets cancelled altogether. 	(0:17:58.65)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It sucks when you lose something you like. 	(0:18:02.21)
Konata Izumi : When do you eat the strawberry on a strawberry shortcake, Kagami? 	(0:18:05.25)
Kagami Hiiragi : Why you asking? 	(0:18:08.69)
Konata Izumi : I was wondering if you were the type to save your favorite for last. 	(0:18:09.23)
Kagami Hiiragi : I usually eat my favorite stuff last... 	(0:18:12.57)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...but with strawberries, it depends on the situation. 	(0:18:15.18)
Konata Izumi : Then do you grill both sides of an onion beef tongue? 	(0:18:17.35)
Kagami Hiiragi : Onion beef tongues? 	(0:18:19.84)
Kagami Hiiragi : It's done in no time anyway... 	(0:18:22.18)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...but it'd go even faster if you did both sides. 	(0:18:23.89)
Konata Izumi : You can't. 	(0:18:25.94)
Konata Izumi : The onions will fall off. 	(0:18:26.85)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't you add the onions after the meat's done? 	(0:18:28.26)
Konata Izumi : Then the onions won't be grilled. 	(0:18:30.98)
Kagami Hiiragi : But aren't the onions just a topping? 	(0:18:33.39)
Konata Izumi : You don't get it at all... 	(0:18:36.32)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : W-Well... 	(0:18:38.03)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Wouldn't they both work...? 	(0:18:38.83)
Konata Izumi : Is the head of a choco-cornet the fat or thin end... 	(0:18:41.13)
Konata Izumi : ...which one do you think it is? 	(0:18:43.75)
Kagami Hiiragi : The fat end? 	(0:18:46.43)
Konata Izumi : We think the same. 	(0:18:47.76)
Kagami Hiiragi : Seriously? 	(0:18:49.31)
Konata Izumi : Then which end do you eat from? 	(0:18:50.21)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't you cut off the thin end... 	(0:18:52.60)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...and eat it with the excess chocolate? 	(0:18:53.94)
Kagami Hiiragi : Have you ever made any real-life friends besides us? 	(0:19:03.88)
Konata Izumi : I guess I had a really close friend back in middle school. 	(0:19:08.99)
Kagami Hiiragi : So you had one. 	(0:19:13.54)
Konata Izumi : I haven't been in touch for a while... 	(0:19:15.37)
Konata Izumi : Wonder what she's up to... 	(0:19:17.80)
Konata Izumi : She wrote in our graduation book... 	(0:19:22.30)
Konata Izumi : ...that her dream was to become a mage. 	(0:19:24.97)
Kagami Hiiragi : So she was one of your kind?! 	(0:19:26.81)
Akira Kogami : Morning luckies! 	(0:19:33.73)
Akira Kogami : It's finally time for Lucky Channel! 	(0:19:35.39)
Akira Kogami : Now being broadcast on TV! 	(0:19:38.24)
Akira Kogami : Okay! 	(0:19:40.07)
Akira Kogami : Hello to everyone who's meeting us for the first time! 	(0:19:41.07)
Akira Kogami : I'll be your navigator, Kogami Akira. 	(0:19:43.08)
Minoru Shiraishi : I'm Shiraishi. 	(0:19:46.49)
Akira Kogami : Who're you? 	(0:19:49.28)
Akira Kogami : Just kidding! 	(0:19:50.03)
Akira Kogami : This person will be helping me out from now on. 	(0:19:51.33)
Akira Kogami : Shiraishi Minoru-san! 	(0:19:54.13)
Akira Kogami : Da-dada-dum! 	(0:19:55.67)
Minoru Shiraishi : Uh... 	(0:19:57.29)
Minoru Shiraishi : I'll be serving as Akira-sama's assistant. 	(0:19:58.22)
Minoru Shiraishi : I'm Shiraishi Minoru. 	(0:20:00.72)
Minoru Shiraishi : Nice to meet you. 	(0:20:02.39)
Akira Kogami : Oh? 	(0:20:03.09)
Akira Kogami : Shiraishi-san you're a bit tense. 	(0:20:04.14)
Akira Kogami : Come on. 	(0:20:06.01)
Akira Kogami : You're finally on TV now. 	(0:20:06.97)
Akira Kogami : Be more crazy! 	(0:20:08.60)
Akira Kogami : Just kidding! 	(0:20:10.31)
Minoru Shiraishi : Sorry. 	(0:20:10.85)
Minoru Shiraishi : I'm not used to this. 	(0:20:11.65)
Akira Kogami : Okay! 	(0:20:12.56)
Akira Kogami : Even though it's early... 	(0:20:13.11)
Akira Kogami : ...but we've already received commemorative postcards from lots of people! 	(0:20:14.11)
Minoru Shiraishi : Ah, right. 	(0:20:16.86)
Minoru Shiraishi : Um... 	(0:20:17.86)
Minoru Shiraishi : This is from I Love Berry-Kou in Osaka. 	(0:20:18.74)
Minoru Shiraishi : Congratulations on Lucky Channel making it to TV. 	(0:20:22.03)
Akira Kogami : Thank you! 	(0:20:24.87)
Minoru Shiraishi : By the way, I have a question for Akira-san. 	(0:20:25.90)
Minoru Shiraishi : You are a well-known super idol. 	(0:20:28.45)
Minoru Shiraishi : How much exactly is an idol paid? 	(0:20:31.46)
Minoru Shiraishi : Please let me know. 	(0:20:33.71)
Akira Kogami : Pay? 	(0:20:38.37)
Minoru Shiraishi : That's a rather direct question. 	(0:20:40.75)
Akira Kogami : Y'know... 	(0:20:43.80)
Akira Kogami : What's the point in even asking that? 	(0:20:45.43)
Minoru Shiraishi : A-Akira-sama? 	(0:20:47.39)
Akira Kogami : Well, if you really want to know, I'll tell you. 	(0:20:48.72)
Akira Kogami : To be frank, it jumps all over. 	(0:20:51.12)
Akira Kogami : Sometimes, it's just cheap pay... 	(0:20:52.63)
Akira Kogami : ...and then there's your agency. 	(0:20:54.38)
Akira Kogami : I'm still on a fixed salary... 	(0:20:55.65)
Akira Kogami : ...so who knows how much they're skimming off. 	(0:20:57.23)
Akira Kogami : And I've been working since I was three... 	(0:21:00.18)
Akira Kogami : ...so all the money still goes to my parents. 	(0:21:02.64)
Akira Kogami : I only get a small allowance from them. 	(0:21:05.41)
Akira Kogami : And boy, do they skimp. 	(0:21:08.08)
Akira Kogami : Come to think of it, Mama's been buying a bunch of name brand purses recently. 	(0:21:10.66)
Akira Kogami : Is she paying for that with the money from this show? 	(0:21:13.96)
Akira Kogami : Don't mess with me! 	(0:21:16.38)
Akira Kogami : Am I supposed to be Cinderella?! 	(0:21:17.96)
Minoru Shiraishi : Wait... 	(0:21:18.85)
Akira Kogami : Just because Papa hasn't sent you any money recently... 	(0:21:19.76)
Minoru Shiraishi : Hold on! 	(0:21:21.71)
Akira Kogami : ...doesn't make me your piggy bank! 	(0:21:22.23)
Minoru Shiraishi : You don't have to bring that up! 	(0:21:22.49)
Akira Kogami : Oh no! 	(0:21:25.63)
Akira Kogami : It's time to say goodbye! 	(0:21:26.72)
Akira Kogami : Akira's so sad! 	(0:21:28.64)
Akira Kogami : And so... 	(0:21:30.27)
Akira Kogami : ...in this segment send us all sorts of questions and praise for me... 	(0:21:31.23)
Akira Kogami : ...as well as any comments about the show, please☆! 	(0:21:34.80)
Akira Kogami : Shiraishi-san, ask them with a please☆! 	(0:21:37.77)
Minoru Shiraishi : Then we hope you'll be back next time. 	(0:21:40.64)
Akira Kogami : See ya! 	(0:21:43.32)
Akira Kogami : Oh, yeah. 	(0:21:45.77)
Akira Kogami : Are you seriously going to show up in the actual show? 	(0:21:46.45)
Akira Kogami : Who told you that? 	(0:21:49.69)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : The four of us don't karaoke together very often. 	(0:21:52.70)
Miyuki Takara : I rarely come to these places. 	(0:21:55.31)
Konata Izumi : C'mon. C'mon. 	(0:21:58.48)
Konata Izumi : We only have two hours, so start singing! 	(0:21:59.34)
Kagami Hiiragi : You don't need to rush us. 	(0:22:01.95)
Kagami Hiiragi : We still have time. 	(0:22:03.57)
Miyuki Takara : This is kind of exciting. 	(0:22:04.91)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It's really fun. 	(0:22:07.39)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It feels really good when you sing. 	(0:22:09.10)
Kagami Hiiragi : Huh? 	(0:22:10.93)
Kagami Hiiragi : Where's the catalog? 	(0:22:11.31)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Catalog? 	(0:22:12.25)
Kagami Hiiragi : The catalog. 	(0:22:13.34)
Miyuki Takara : The catalog, is it? 	(0:22:14.23)
Kagami Hiiragi : You know. 	(0:22:15.44)
Kagami Hiiragi : The thing with all the song numbers in it. 	(0:22:16.10)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : This? 	(0:22:18.14)
Kagami Hiiragi : Yes. 	(0:22:18.94)
Konata Izumi : Then I'll start! 	(0:22:19.44)
Kagami Hiiragi : You move fast! 	(0:22:20.98)
Kagami Hiiragi : And she already queued up three songs! 	(0:22:22.56)
Konata Izumi : It'll be a waste if you don't load up the list. 	(0:22:24.19)
Kagami Hiiragi : What's this song? 	(0:22:29.26)
Konata Izumi : Space Ironmen Kyodain! 	(0:22:31.10)
Konata Izumi : You've gotta start with this one! 	(0:22:33.78)
Kagami Hiiragi : Never heard of it. 	(0:22:35.81)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Go for it, Kona-chan! 	(0:22:37.36)
Kagami Hiiragi : Konata! 	(0:22:39.02)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're too loud! 	(0:22:39.98)
Kagami Hiiragi : Turn it down! 	(0:22:42.44)
Kagami Hiiragi : Why does she know this song? 	(0:22:45.96)
EXTRA : Well, next time on Lucky Star: 	(0:23:22.87)
Konata Izumi : I'm Konata. 	(0:23:25.00)
Konata Izumi : So sleepy... 	(0:23:26.37)
Konata Izumi : Why am I always so sleepy... 	(0:23:27.47)
Konata Izumi : ...the day after I get a lot of sleep? 	(0:23:29.92)
Konata Izumi : Doesn't that defeat the purpose of sleeping a lot? 	(0:23:32.55)
Konata Izumi : Next time: 	(0:23:35.18)
Konata Izumi : Effort and Results. 	(0:23:35.87)
EXTRA : Look forward to next time! 	(0:23:37.94)
Kagami Hiiragi : Right? 	(0:01:31.09)
Kagami Hiiragi : Doesn't it stink? 	(0:01:31.80)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Sure does! 	(0:01:33.14)
Tadao Hiiragi : Golden Week's almost over... 	(0:01:35.34)
Tadao Hiiragi : Did you already take care of your homework? 	(0:01:37.98)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Not yet, actually... 	(0:01:41.93)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You know how you can't help having fun on long vacations? 	(0:01:44.60)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : We're in trouble now! 	(0:01:48.11)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Right, onee-chan? 	(0:01:49.86)
Kagami Hiiragi : Sorry. 	(0:01:51.31)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'm almost done. 	(0:01:52.11)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : But you've been playing with me the whole time... 	(0:01:54.86)
Kagami Hiiragi : Thanks for the food. 	(0:02:16.03)
Kagami Hiiragi : I have a question about this part... 	(0:02:21.57)
Matsuri Hiiragi : How would I know the answers if you don't? 	(0:02:23.21)
Kagami Hiiragi : Aren't you in college?! 	(0:02:26.21)
Miki Hiiragi : Go wake up Tsukasa already. 	(0:02:29.79)
Kagami Hiiragi : No way. 	(0:02:31.92)
Kagami Hiiragi : She's not gonna wake up. 	(0:02:32.63)
Miki Hiiragi : Wake up already! 	(0:02:34.88)
Kagami Hiiragi : Otou-san and the others sure are late. 	(0:02:37.88)
Matsuri Hiiragi : Didn't he have a groundbreaking ceremony this morning? 	(0:02:39.88)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What... 	(0:02:42.18)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...time is it? 	(0:02:43.39)
Tadao Hiiragi : I'm home. 	(0:02:43.72)
Miki Hiiragi : It's already noon. 	(0:02:44.40)
Kagami Hiiragi : Welcome home. 	(0:02:45.73)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Good morning... 	(0:02:47.81)
Kagami Hiiragi : It's already past noon. 	(0:02:49.15)
Matsuri Hiiragi : I can't believe how you can sleep so much. 	(0:02:50.53)
Kagami Hiiragi : Did you see the special final episode of Apron of Love last night? 	(0:02:53.88)
Konata Izumi : Nope. 	(0:02:56.82)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I fell asleep halfway through. 	(0:02:57.74)
Kagami Hiiragi : You were asleep? 	(0:02:59.44)
Kagami Hiiragi : It got really crazy! 	(0:03:00.72)
Kagami Hiiragi : A guy balanced a red wash basin on top of his head at the end! 	(0:03:02.77)
Miki Hiiragi : Kagami! 	(0:03:15.52)
Miki Hiiragi : You have a call from Miyuki-chan! 	(0:03:16.77)
Kagami Hiiragi : Okay. 	(0:03:19.03)
Miyuki Takara : Would you like to hold a study session for checking homework answers? 	(0:03:20.24)
Kagami Hiiragi : Sounds great! 	(0:03:25.03)
Kagami Hiiragi : Let's do that! 	(0:03:25.75)
Miki Hiiragi : Kagami! 	(0:03:26.78)
Miki Hiiragi : You have a call from Konata-chan! 	(0:03:27.79)
Konata Izumi : How about we do a study session for finishing off homework? 	(0:03:30.58)
Kagami Hiiragi : Wait one sec! 	(0:03:33.84)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're just going to copy my answers, aren't you?! 	(0:03:34.72)
Konata Izumi : So let me copy your homework. 	(0:03:37.32)
Kagami Hiiragi : Right to the point, huh? 	(0:03:40.01)
Kagami Hiiragi : You can copy them... 	(0:03:41.95)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...but if you don't do the homework yourself... 	(0:03:43.85)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...you'll totally bomb the test after vacation. 	(0:03:45.37)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You're right... 	(0:03:48.64)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : We'll only end up hurting ourselves... 	(0:03:50.35)
Konata Izumi : I'm good at winging stuff the night before, so I'll be fine. 	(0:03:52.64)
Konata Izumi : So let me copy. 	(0:03:55.44)
Kagami Hiiragi : At least pretend to be guilty! 	(0:03:56.20)
Miyuki Takara : I'm sorry to intrude. 	(0:04:00.03)
Kagami Hiiragi : Oh, welcome! 	(0:04:01.05)
Konata Izumi : Welcome! 	(0:04:01.49)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Welcome! 	(0:04:01.49)
Miyuki Takara : Oh. 	(0:04:03.06)
Miyuki Takara : Are you also here to study, Izumi-san? 	(0:04:03.72)
Kagami Hiiragi : No. 	(0:04:05.70)
Konata Izumi : She's just copying. 	(0:04:06.21)
Kagami Hiiragi : Anyway... 	(0:04:08.45)
Kagami Hiiragi : You've barely touched it. 	(0:04:09.42)
Kagami Hiiragi : What were you doing during break? 	(0:04:11.91)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Um... 	(0:04:14.83)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Twenty-three pages of math... 	(0:04:17.19)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Twenty pages of world history... 	(0:04:19.16)
Konata Izumi : Finally made it to the Imperial Gate. 	(0:04:20.07)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Thirty pages of English... 	(0:04:20.91)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : We have five days of vacation. 	(0:04:24.28)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Assuming five hours spent a day... 	(0:04:26.58)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : No, four hours... 	(0:04:27.79)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That means 1.15 pages of math an hour. 	(0:04:30.33)
Konata Izumi : Getting a lot more experience than I expected. 	(0:04:34.50)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Oh no! 	(0:04:35.46)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I haven't done any work today! 	(0:04:36.58)
Konata Izumi : Wonder how much more I need for a level. 	(0:04:38.54)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Um... 	(0:04:39.04)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I have three days left... 	(0:04:40.34)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : So let's go with six hours a day? 	(0:04:41.97)
Konata Izumi : Found a loincloth! 	(0:04:42.71)
EXTRA : Nobody remembers the name of the guy who spent ten years... 	(0:04:44.67)
EXTRA : ...watching over new workers. 	(0:04:47.01)
Konata Izumi : This is starting to get really slow. 	(0:04:47.26)
Konata Izumi : It's Yutaka. 	(0:04:49.40)
Konata Izumi : Well, I'm almost maxed out. 	(0:04:50.31)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Two days left! 	(0:04:50.60)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : If I cram for the last two days... 	(0:04:51.81)
Konata Izumi : So all that's left is... 	(0:04:53.36)
Tadao Hiiragi : Golden Week's almost over... 	(0:04:54.56)
Tadao Hiiragi : Did you already take care of your homework? 	(0:04:57.36)
Konata Izumi : How about we do a study session for finishing off homework? 	(0:05:00.56)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I wanted to do everything just as planned... 	(0:05:04.05)
Kagami Hiiragi : Mission failed. 	(0:05:07.47)
Konata Izumi : Shouldn't have even bothered. 	(0:05:08.93)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're even worse! 	(0:05:10.52)
Kagami Hiiragi : So she ended up doing it herself, huh? 	(0:05:20.73)
Kagami Hiiragi : I guess she's still a hard-working girl deep down. 	(0:05:24.13)
Kagami Hiiragi : But her accuracy rate is too much for me to bear! 	(0:05:30.89)
Kagami Hiiragi : Horrible. 	(0:05:33.79)
Kagami Hiiragi : Just too horrible! 	(0:05:34.50)
Nanako Kuroi : Hey! 	(0:05:35.69)
Nanako Kuroi : Did you all have a fun vacation? 	(0:05:37.13)
Nanako Kuroi : Then again... 	(0:05:39.09)
Nanako Kuroi : You had bunches of homework... 	(0:05:40.15)
Nanako Kuroi : ...and a test right after vacation... 	(0:05:41.74)
Nanako Kuroi : ...so you couldn't have been having fun the whole time. 	(0:05:43.89)
Minoru Shiraishi : It barely felt like a vacation. 	(0:05:47.05)
Nanako Kuroi : So sad. 	(0:05:49.77)
Nanako Kuroi : Too bad, but I didn't let anything worry me and played around! 	(0:05:50.64)
Konata Izumi : Sensei. 	(0:05:52.62)
Konata Izumi : I also didn't let anything worry me and played around! 	(0:05:54.06)
Nanako Kuroi : Oi! 	(0:05:56.27)
Kagami Hiiragi : Aren't these things designed so you can never get anything? 	(0:05:58.48)
Konata Izumi : Depends on what you're going for. 	(0:06:02.61)
Konata Izumi : Some things are especially hard to grab. 	(0:06:03.95)
Kagami Hiiragi : Right? 	(0:06:06.86)
Kagami Hiiragi : I could never bring myself to touch one of these machines. 	(0:06:07.79)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Incredible! 	(0:06:14.10)
Konata Izumi : Nah. 	(0:06:15.29)
Konata Izumi : I already knew this one was gettable. 	(0:06:16.00)
Kagami Hiiragi : So maybe... 	(0:06:18.81)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...if I went after that one... 	(0:06:19.71)
Konata Izumi : I might actually get it. 	(0:06:21.88)
Konata Izumi : Is that what you're thinking? 	(0:06:23.42)
Kagami Hiiragi : Nope! No way! 	(0:06:25.42)
Kagami Hiiragi : B-But... 	(0:06:27.57)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...I guess I'll give it a try. 	(0:06:28.83)
Konata Izumi : So you wanna. 	(0:06:30.11)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Onee-chan go for it! 	(0:06:31.00)
Kagami Hiiragi : Thought I had it... 	(0:06:37.31)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Too bad... 	(0:06:38.94)
Kagami Hiiragi : Huh? 	(0:06:42.44)
Kagami Hiiragi : No way! 	(0:06:48.15)
Kagami Hiiragi : Why?! 	(0:06:49.22)
Konata Izumi : A great person once said... 	(0:06:50.11)
Konata Izumi : ...that a UFO catcher is like a piggy bank. 	(0:06:51.91)
Kagami Hiiragi : Smart guy... 	(0:06:54.37)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Not again! 	(0:06:59.39)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : No! 	(0:07:00.06)
EXTRA : Here are your scores! 	(0:07:03.94)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I was hopeless... 	(0:07:04.27)
EXTRA : You achieved Taiko Rank 1! 	(0:07:05.53)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Kona-chan, you've a great sense of rhythm. 	(0:07:06.96)
EXTRA : You achieved Taiko Rank 5! 	(0:07:07.53)
Konata Izumi : Nah. 	(0:07:09.08)
Konata Izumi : It's got nothing to do with rhythm. 	(0:07:09.45)
Konata Izumi : The skills you pick up from gaming are usually useless in everyday life. 	(0:07:11.68)
Kagami Hiiragi : I can see that clearly when I look at you. 	(0:07:16.73)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Kona-chan, you're so strong! 	(0:07:38.54)
Konata Izumi : Pretty much. 	(0:07:40.21)
Kagami Hiiragi : How much time has she spent on this thing? 	(0:07:41.42)
Nanako Kuroi : Izumi? 	(0:07:44.42)
Nanako Kuroi : Is Izumi absent today? 	(0:07:46.79)
EXTRA : Kuroi-sensei. 	(0:07:48.84)
EXTRA : You have a call from Izumi-san. 	(0:07:49.97)
Nanako Kuroi : Yes. 	(0:07:52.09)
Nanako Kuroi : This is Kuroi speaking. 	(0:07:52.64)
Konata Izumi : Teacher, I'm terribly sorry... 	(0:07:54.43)
Konata Izumi : ...but I need to take a sick day... 	(0:07:55.94)
Nanako Kuroi : Oh Izumi? That's unusual. 	(0:07:58.02)
Nanako Kuroi : Is it a cold? 	(0:08:00.02)
Konata Izumi : No. 	(0:08:00.58)
Konata Izumi : It's a bad case of May sickness. 	(0:08:01.44)
Konata Izumi : I can barely move... 	(0:08:03.31)
Nanako Kuroi : Hurry up and get here, now! 	(0:08:05.21)
Kagami Hiiragi : Hey! 	(0:08:09.32)
Kagami Hiiragi : We're leaving. 	(0:08:10.28)
Kagami Hiiragi : Why is your bag so full? 	(0:08:13.78)
Konata Izumi : Testing starts tomorrow... 	(0:08:16.87)
Konata Izumi : ...so I have to take everything home for an all-nighter. 	(0:08:18.72)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't tell me... 	(0:08:21.75)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...you kept all your books here? 	(0:08:22.75)
Kagami Hiiragi : Honestly... 	(0:08:25.71)
Kagami Hiiragi : Waiting till the day before a test to take your textbooks home... 	(0:08:26.72)
Kagami Hiiragi : You'll never make it in time! 	(0:08:29.76)
Konata Izumi : But I've always made it through like this. 	(0:08:31.84)
Kagami Hiiragi : You sure sound confident. 	(0:08:34.24)
Kagami Hiiragi : Well. 	(0:08:36.31)
Kagami Hiiragi : Show me how far you can go with that. 	(0:08:36.73)
Nanako Kuroi : Okay! 	(0:08:48.98)
Nanako Kuroi : I'll return the tests you took the other day. 	(0:08:49.86)
Kagami Hiiragi : So-so, I guess. 	(0:08:54.49)
Kagami Hiiragi : How was it? 	(0:08:55.88)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It's like, it didnt work out... 	(0:08:57.24)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Even though I worked hard. 	(0:08:59.00)
Kagami Hiiragi : Well, now... 	(0:09:00.66)
Kagami Hiiragi : What about Miss All-nighter? 	(0:09:01.42)
Konata Izumi : Thanks to you, just fine! 	(0:09:02.70)
Kagami Hiiragi : Somehow that's just wrong! 	(0:09:03.96)
Konata Izumi : So tired... 	(0:09:10.48)
Konata Izumi : I don't feel like doing anything... 	(0:09:11.59)
Kagami Hiiragi : Come on. 	(0:09:13.60)
Kagami Hiiragi : Let's go. 	(0:09:14.22)
Kagami Hiiragi : But you still ended up wandering around with us, huh? 	(0:09:17.05)
Konata Izumi : Comp Festival! 	(0:09:20.85)
Konata Izumi : Discount on all QUO cards! 	(0:09:21.98)
Konata Izumi : Gotta collect 'em all! 	(0:09:23.55)
Konata Izumi : Okay. 	(0:09:25.06)
Konata Izumi : Time to get a job. 	(0:09:25.73)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're so easy to read. 	(0:09:27.10)
Kagami Hiiragi : Seriously... 	(0:09:31.15)
Kagami Hiiragi : I've never heard of anyone being absent for May sickness. 	(0:09:32.28)
Miyuki Takara : I can understand how she feels though. 	(0:09:36.16)
Konata Izumi : Doesn't it say sickness in the name? 	(0:09:38.16)
Konata Izumi : Shouldn't it count as a serious disease? 	(0:09:40.00)
Kagami Hiiragi : Do you seriously mean that? 	(0:09:41.87)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What exactly is May sickness again? 	(0:09:45.04)
Kagami Hiiragi : Miyuki. 	(0:09:48.12)
Kagami Hiiragi : Tell her. 	(0:09:49.28)
Miyuki Takara : Let's see... 	(0:09:50.50)
Miyuki Takara : It begins with the feeling of achievement one experiences... 	(0:09:51.72)
Miyuki Takara : ...after accomplishing a major goal such as getting into college or getting a new job. 	(0:09:53.59)
Miyuki Takara : When new relationships beginning in April don't work out as well as you'd like... 	(0:09:56.89)
Miyuki Takara : ...you are unable to keep up with the gap between the new life you imagined and reality. 	(0:10:01.35)
Miyuki Takara : As a result, you feel helpless and weary. 	(0:10:06.27)
Miyuki Takara : So plain lethargy might not be considered May sickness... 	(0:10:09.64)
Kagami Hiiragi : Besides, it's got nothing to do with... 	(0:10:14.11)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...second-years in high school like us. 	(0:10:16.66)
Konata Izumi : I'm always pumped by the change of pace in spring. 	(0:10:18.54)
Kagami Hiiragi : Oh, really. 	(0:10:22.54)
Kagami Hiiragi : Still, while I'm not as bad as Konata... 	(0:10:24.03)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...I do feel unusually tired this time of year. 	(0:10:26.09)
Kagami Hiiragi : Once I'm home... 	(0:10:28.71)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...I can't bring myself to do homework. 	(0:10:30.30)
Konata Izumi : Me too! 	(0:10:32.42)
Kagami Hiiragi : Nobody's gonna comment? 	(0:10:36.88)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What's wrong, Yuki-chan? You're sighing and stuff. 	(0:10:41.95)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Just like when I talked about contact lenses... 	(0:10:45.81)
Miyuki Takara : ...I'm embarrassed to talk about this too but... 	(0:10:48.07)
Miyuki Takara : ...the dentist scares me, so I've been avoiding going there... 	(0:10:50.53)
Miyuki Takara : ...and lately my cavity is getting worse. 	(0:10:52.95)
Miyuki Takara : It even hurts when I drink water. 	(0:10:55.63)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Isn't that... 	(0:11:01.32)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...normal? 	(0:11:02.83)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I'm scared of them as well. 	(0:11:04.29)
Konata Izumi : But why did you avoid the dentist until your teeth started hurting? 	(0:11:06.03)
Miyuki Takara : Strangely enough... 	(0:11:15.34)
Miyuki Takara : Even though I knew it will be hard when my teeth starts to hurt... 	(0:11:16.72)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : For some reason you still don't want to go to the dentist, right? 	(0:11:19.72)
Miyuki Takara : When the pain first starts... 	(0:11:23.43)
Miyuki Takara : ...and while you can still bear the pain... 	(0:11:25.10)
Miyuki Takara : ...you tend to choose not to go. 	(0:11:27.15)
Konata Izumi : Is the dentist really that scary? 	(0:11:30.27)
Konata Izumi : I've never needed to go so I don't know. 	(0:11:32.32)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You've never gone to one? 	(0:11:34.56)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I'm so jealous. 	(0:11:36.11)
Miyuki Takara : There's that antiseptic smell in the dentist's office... 	(0:11:37.82)
Miyuki Takara : Or the tension you feel while you wait. 	(0:11:40.49)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Ooh! Ooh! 	(0:11:42.86)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : And don't forget the sound of the drills! 	(0:11:43.70)
Konata Izumi : Change Getter! 	(0:11:46.10)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It's terrifying! 	(0:11:47.03)
Konata Izumi : But boys probably like to go to the dentist's, right? 	(0:11:48.74)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Why? 	(0:11:52.04)
Konata Izumi : Aren't drills like a man's romance? 	(0:11:52.51)
Konata Izumi : Dinosaur Empire! 	(0:11:55.08)
Konata Izumi : I've heard they love it when robots fight using drills as a weapon! 	(0:11:56.46)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : But they probably would not like having their teeth drilled... 	(0:12:03.38)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I've been wondering... 	(0:12:07.14)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Aren't the receptionists and assistants... 	(0:12:08.90)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...usually pretty ladies? 	(0:12:11.57)
Miyuki Takara : Now that you mention it, it does seem that way... 	(0:12:13.06)
Konata Izumi : Wonder why... 	(0:12:15.50)
Miyuki Takara : Perhaps it's one of their hiring criteria... 	(0:12:16.68)
Konata Izumi : Beautiful assistants and drills, huh? 	(0:12:20.11)
Miyuki Takara : That does indeed sound like something geared towards males. 	(0:12:30.04)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Then... 	(0:12:33.67)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What would a dentist's office for females be like? 	(0:12:34.17)
Konata Izumi : First off, you'd have to get rid of that smell! 	(0:12:37.33)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : And switch the patient's chair for a soft and fluffy, auto-massaging recliner. 	(0:12:40.50)
Miyuki Takara : Then aromatherapy is a must as well, right? 	(0:12:45.68)
Miyuki Takara : And include a foot massage while you're being treated. 	(0:12:48.35)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Ah, that sounds nice. 	(0:12:53.10)
Konata Izumi : And to numb the pain, they let you play games. 	(0:12:54.28)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : A game might me a little hard to play... 	(0:12:58.49)
Miyuki Takara : But it's a good idea to distract you from the pain. 	(0:13:00.57)
Konata Izumi : Like putting headphones on and listening to music you like. 	(0:13:03.66)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Sounds good. 	(0:13:07.32)
Miyuki Takara : That would also be nice. 	(0:13:08.08)
Miyuki Takara : But I still don't like the dentist's. 	(0:13:14.20)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That's true. 	(0:13:17.30)
Konata Izumi : What's this?! 	(0:13:18.44)
Kagami Hiiragi : What's wrong? 	(0:13:19.84)
Konata Izumi : Well... 	(0:13:20.89)
Konata Izumi : They're animating another series I like... 	(0:13:21.43)
Konata Izumi : ...but they're using a completely different cast from the drama CD. 	(0:13:24.14)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't get it. 	(0:13:28.45)
Konata Izumi : Was this the work of a god yet again? 	(0:13:30.76)
Konata Izumi : Politics? 	(0:13:33.48)
Konata Izumi : Money? 	(0:13:34.15)
Kagami Hiiragi : I never buy drama CDs so... 	(0:13:34.98)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...as long as the voices match the original characters... 	(0:13:37.86)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...I'm fine with whoever they use. 	(0:13:39.49)
Konata Izumi : It doesn't work that way, Kagami. 	(0:13:41.66)
Konata Izumi : People who have gotten used to the drama CD... 	(0:13:43.95)
Konata Izumi : ...feel like something's wrong when they start watching the anime. 	(0:13:46.58)
Konata Izumi : And it takes quite a bit of time for the feeling to go away. 	(0:13:49.62)
Konata Izumi : Even so... 	(0:13:54.04)
Konata Izumi : ...there's one good thing that comes out of this. 	(0:13:54.92)
Kagami Hiiragi : What's that? 	(0:13:57.41)
Konata Izumi : Drama CD and anime. 	(0:13:58.26)
Konata Izumi : You can enjoy two different worlds through them. 	(0:13:59.84)
Konata Izumi : Same candy, but twice as tasty! 	(0:14:02.64)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're a strong customer, huh? 	(0:14:04.55)
EXTRA : Thank you very much! 	(0:14:07.22)
Konata Izumi : Well... 	(0:14:08.49)
Konata Izumi : One of us will be taking Miyuki-san's leftover nugget... 	(0:14:09.27)
Konata Izumi : Let's say it goes to whoever wins a staring contest. 	(0:14:14.72)
Kagami Hiiragi : Wha— 	(0:14:17.40)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're like a little kid. 	(0:14:17.98)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : A staring contest? 	(0:14:19.24)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That sounds fun! 	(0:14:20.49)
Konata Izumi : Kagami's probably gonna lose. 	(0:14:21.65)
Kagami Hiiragi : Did you say something? 	(0:14:23.61)
Konata Izumi : Then let's go... 	(0:14:24.51)
Konata Izumi : It's a stare-down! 	(0:14:25.78)
Kagami Hiiragi : That was... 	(0:14:33.64)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...too much! 	(0:14:34.77)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Amazing... 	(0:14:36.11)
Kagami Hiiragi : You... 	(0:14:37.77)
Kagami Hiiragi : You didn't even look human! 	(0:14:38.65)
Konata Izumi : Hey, you guys are overreacting. 	(0:14:40.08)
Miyuki Takara : Sorry to have kept you waiting. 	(0:14:42.86)
Miyuki Takara : There was a long line for the restroom. 	(0:14:44.51)
Miyuki Takara : Did something happen? 	(0:14:46.67)
Kagami Hiiragi : Hey. 	(0:14:47.95)
Kagami Hiiragi : Show that face to Miyuki! 	(0:14:48.87)
Konata Izumi : I don't wanna. 	(0:14:51.41)
Kagami Hiiragi : Miyuki, it was incredible! 	(0:14:52.56)
Kagami Hiiragi : I've never seen anything like it! 	(0:14:54.21)
Konata Izumi : Well then... 	(0:14:57.10)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It's amazing every time I see it! 	(0:15:02.83)
Miyuki Takara : That face may come in handy during the talent stage of entrance exams. 	(0:15:05.07)
Kagami Hiiragi : That's right, Konata! 	(0:15:09.40)
Kagami Hiiragi : Use that to apply to college. 	(0:15:10.81)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'm sure you'll get accepted! 	(0:15:12.25)
Konata Izumi : That doesn't really make me happy. 	(0:15:14.16)
Konata Izumi : There was this thing on TV about the average number of books a person in Japan reads annually. 	(0:15:16.54)
Konata Izumi : "Manga's are not allowed. Ordinary books only, please!"... 	(0:15:20.75)
Konata Izumi : ...is what they were saying. 	(0:15:24.00)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Well, manga is, you know... 	(0:15:25.13)
Konata Izumi : Do light novels count? 	(0:15:26.47)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I'm not sure. 	(0:15:29.34)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Light novels should be okay I guess... 	(0:15:30.60)
Konata Izumi : What about picture books? 	(0:15:33.09)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Since they're called books, they might count... 	(0:15:36.64)
Konata Izumi : Also for the same fantasy genre... 	(0:15:39.43)
Konata Izumi : ...if you say that stuff like Harry Potter is normal... 	(0:15:41.24)
Konata Izumi : ...then everyone would nod in agreement. 	(0:15:43.50)
Konata Izumi : So what do you call a normal book? 	(0:15:45.86)
Konata Izumi : And the TV show ended by saying... 	(0:15:50.76)
Konata Izumi : ...how young people are veering away from reading on the whole. 	(0:15:53.37)
Konata Izumi : But nowadays, we use the net to look at all sorts of websites and blogs. 	(0:15:57.83)
Konata Izumi : So I think we have a higher percentage of reading, right? 	(0:16:01.25)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I get it, and then I don't... 	(0:16:06.71)
Kagami Hiiragi : Yo. 	(0:16:09.42)
Kagami Hiiragi : You two, lets go home! 	(0:16:09.97)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Wait a bit. 	(0:16:11.26)
Konata Izumi : Sorry. 	(0:16:13.01)
Konata Izumi : I can't go home with you guys. 	(0:16:13.68)
Kagami Hiiragi : Do you have something to do? 	(0:16:16.09)
Kagami Hiiragi : That's unusual. 	(0:16:17.69)
Konata Izumi : I started working. 	(0:16:19.26)
Kagami Hiiragi : Wait! 	(0:16:24.02)
Kagami Hiiragi : She actually got a job! 	(0:16:24.94)
Kagami Hiiragi : Is Comp Festival really that important?! 	(0:16:26.49)
Kagami Hiiragi : Anyway... 	(0:16:30.61)
Kagami Hiiragi : Konata sure surprised me. 	(0:16:31.70)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : She sure did. 	(0:16:33.70)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : She really got a job. 	(0:16:35.00)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I thought she was just joking. 	(0:16:37.29)
Kagami Hiiragi : That's also true... 	(0:16:39.72)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...but I was talking about how somebody actually hired her. 	(0:16:41.95)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Th-That's a little harsh... 	(0:16:44.96)
Kagami Hiiragi : Besides... 	(0:16:47.04)
Kagami Hiiragi : I can't even imagine her working diligently . 	(0:16:47.86)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Th-That's true... 	(0:16:51.39)
Kagami Hiiragi : I wonder where she's working. 	(0:16:53.09)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Maybe at a bookstore? 	(0:16:55.41)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Since she likes manga? 	(0:16:57.21)
EXTRA : Excuse me. 	(0:16:59.51)
EXTRA : I'd like this. 	(0:17:00.31)
Konata Izumi : Hold on. 	(0:17:00.77)
Konata Izumi : I'm busy right now. 	(0:17:01.81)
Konata Izumi : Got em! 	(0:17:06.12)
Kagami Hiiragi : I hope she doesn't get fired... 	(0:17:07.48)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Then how about a convenience store? 	(0:17:09.82)
EXTRA : Excuse me. 	(0:17:12.03)
EXTRA : I'd like this. 	(0:17:12.74)
Konata Izumi : Fourhundredninetyeightyen. 	(0:17:14.36)
Konata Izumi : Exactchange. 	(0:17:17.82)
Konata Izumi : Thankyoupleasecomeagain. 	(0:17:21.08)
Kagami Hiiragi : I can't see it. 	(0:17:23.25)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Then what about a fast food place? 	(0:17:24.46)
Konata Izumi : I'm smiling. What about it? 	(0:17:26.06)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I don't see it happening... 	(0:17:27.33)
Kagami Hiiragi : I guess that also eliminates a family restaurant. 	(0:17:28.76)
Konata Izumi : Welcome. 	(0:17:30.78)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Honestly, what is she doing? 	(0:17:32.38)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Maybe something like traffic survey? 	(0:17:35.67)
Kagami Hiiragi : No way. 	(0:17:37.27)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Video rental store? 	(0:17:38.18)
Kagami Hiiragi : I wonder... 	(0:17:39.44)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : A bar. 	(0:17:40.60)
Kagami Hiiragi : Nah that's not it. 	(0:17:41.40)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Pizza delivery. 	(0:17:42.48)
Kagami Hiiragi : No driver's license. 	(0:17:43.36)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Supermarket cashier. 	(0:17:44.48)
Kagami Hiiragi : Impossible. 	(0:17:45.73)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Cram school sensei. 	(0:17:46.23)
Kagami Hiiragi : Unthinkable. 	(0:17:47.15)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : A bread factory! 	(0:17:47.99)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That leaves... 	(0:17:49.40)
Kagami Hiiragi : Let's ask her tomorrow. 	(0:17:52.07)
Kagami Hiiragi : Hey, Konata. 	(0:17:53.98)
Kagami Hiiragi : What kind of place are you working at? 	(0:17:55.03)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Tell us! 	(0:17:57.24)
Konata Izumi : Just an ordinary cosplay café. 	(0:18:00.32)
Kagami Hiiragi : It fits her so perfectly! 	(0:18:02.95)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It fits her so perfectly! 	(0:18:02.95)
Kagami Hiiragi : But is that kind of place really okay? 	(0:18:04.79)
Akira Kogami : Morning luckies! 	(0:18:11.79)
Akira Kogami : I'm Kogami Akira! 	(0:18:13.68)
Akira Kogami : This is the second episode of Lucky Channel! 	(0:18:15.01)
Akira Kogami : Akira's going all-out! 	(0:18:17.43)
Akira Kogami : O-kay! 	(0:18:20.30)
Akira Kogami : Next to me... 	(0:18:21.27)
Akira Kogami : ...is a wonderful onii-san who will assist me. 	(0:18:22.39)
Akira Kogami : Shiraishi Minoru-san! 	(0:18:25.15)
Minoru Shiraishi : I'm Akira-sama's assistant, Shiraishi Minoru. 	(0:18:30.27)
Minoru Shiraishi : I'm just a beginner... 	(0:18:33.11)
Minoru Shiraishi : ...so I hope that you'll at least remember my name. 	(0:18:34.74)
Minoru Shiraishi : Yes. 	(0:18:37.12)
Akira Kogami : Clap. Clap. Clap. 	(0:18:37.59)
Akira Kogami : Okay! 	(0:18:39.51)
Akira Kogami : This segment's only just begun... 	(0:18:40.21)
Akira Kogami : ...but we already have an eruption of messages from everyone! 	(0:18:42.58)
Akira Kogami : Akira's super happy! 	(0:18:46.75)
Akira Kogami : Thanks you! 	(0:18:48.67)
Minoru Shiraishi : Man... 	(0:18:49.44)
Minoru Shiraishi : This is really something. 	(0:18:50.09)
Minoru Shiraishi : I guess this is... 	(0:18:52.01)
Minoru Shiraishi : ...an indication of Akira-sama's popularity. 	(0:18:52.80)
Minoru Shiraishi : Wha— 	(0:18:55.94)
Minoru Shiraishi : What? 	(0:18:57.10)
Akira Kogami : I saw it today. 	(0:18:58.06)
Minoru Shiraishi : Yes? 	(0:18:59.39)
Akira Kogami : You were in it, right? 	(0:19:00.02)
Akira Kogami : In the actual show. 	(0:19:01.30)
Akira Kogami : You were in it, weren't you? 	(0:19:02.89)
Minoru Shiraishi : Yes, they were gracious enough to put me in. 	(0:19:05.00)
Akira Kogami : Well whatever... 	(0:19:08.43)
Akira Kogami : Oh, yeah... 	(0:19:10.28)
Akira Kogami : What scene were you in again? 	(0:19:11.67)
Minoru Shiraishi : Uh, I believe... 	(0:19:14.23)
Minoru Shiraishi : ...scene 45 in part A. 	(0:19:15.95)
Minoru Shiraishi : The classroom scene right after vacation. 	(0:19:17.62)
Akira Kogami : Now I remember. 	(0:19:20.95)
Akira Kogami : You didn't have much of a presence so I forgot. 	(0:19:22.20)
Minoru Shiraishi : Well, I only had one line this time. 	(0:19:25.41)
Akira Kogami : What's that?! 	(0:19:28.08)
Akira Kogami : Not good enough for you?! 	(0:19:29.17)
Minoru Shiraishi : No! Absolutely not! 	(0:19:30.38)
Akira Kogami : Not sure a newbie should be acting that way. 	(0:19:32.42)
Akira Kogami : Y'know, back when I debuted... 	(0:19:35.38)
Minoru Shiraishi : Debuted? 	(0:19:39.38)
Minoru Shiraishi : How old were you then? 	(0:19:40.76)
Akira Kogami : Three. 	(0:19:42.68)
Akira Kogami : Back then, I was happy just to get any lines. 	(0:19:43.73)
Akira Kogami : Getting to speak isn't about the number of lines. 	(0:19:47.02)
Minoru Shiraishi : You're absolutely right. 	(0:19:49.00)
Minoru Shiraishi : My nerves were a wreck after being surrounded by so many great senpais. 	(0:19:50.11)
Minoru Shiraishi : It was an educational experience! 	(0:19:53.40)
Akira Kogami : You were pretty stiff, though. 	(0:19:54.82)
Akira Kogami : Stiff as a board. 	(0:19:57.07)
Akira Kogami : A complete amateur. 	(0:19:58.63)
Akira Kogami : Y'know. 	(0:20:00.19)
Akira Kogami : That was way too...you know... 	(0:20:01.33)
Akira Kogami : Try it again right here. 	(0:20:03.50)
Minoru Shiraishi : Here? 	(0:20:06.41)
Akira Kogami : There's a chance you'll appear again, right? 	(0:20:07.46)
Minoru Shiraishi : I suppose... 	(0:20:10.66)
Akira Kogami : Then you better practice a little, at least. 	(0:20:11.30)
Akira Kogami : I'm offering you help right here! 	(0:20:13.59)
Minoru Shiraishi : I understand now! 	(0:20:15.73)
Minoru Shiraishi : Please help me out! 	(0:20:16.63)
Akira Kogami : Gimme the script. 	(0:20:18.26)
Akira Kogami : Which cut was it again? 	(0:20:20.42)
Minoru Shiraishi : Cut 45. 	(0:20:22.06)
Akira Kogami : This one, huh? 	(0:20:24.68)
Akira Kogami : Then I'll play Kuroi-sensei. 	(0:20:25.28)
Minoru Shiraishi : Please do. 	(0:20:27.77)
Akira Kogami : Ready and... 	(0:20:28.71)
Akira Kogami : Action! 	(0:20:30.31)
Akira Kogami : Hey. 	(0:20:31.68)
Akira Kogami : Did you all have a fun vacation? 	(0:20:32.57)
Akira Kogami : Then again... 	(0:20:34.99)
Akira Kogami : You had b-b— 	(0:20:36.03)
Minoru Shiraishi : Bunches. 	(0:20:37.50)
Akira Kogami : Bunches of homework... 	(0:20:38.53)
Akira Kogami : ...and a test right after vacation... 	(0:20:39.66)
Akira Kogami : ...so you couldn't have been having fun the whole time. 	(0:20:41.87)
Minoru Shiraishi : It barely felt like a vacation. 	(0:20:45.20)
Akira Kogami : What was that? 	(0:20:50.79)
Akira Kogami : No good at all. 	(0:20:52.50)
Akira Kogami : That line had no feeling to it. 	(0:20:53.55)
Minoru Shiraishi : Feel— 	(0:20:55.97)
Akira Kogami : Here! 	(0:20:56.47)
Akira Kogami : Right here! 	(0:20:57.05)
Akira Kogami : You gotta make 'em feel it right here! 	(0:20:57.51)
Minoru Shiraishi : I'm sorry. 	(0:20:59.39)
Akira Kogami : If you're just gonna read your lines, a monkey could handle that. 	(0:21:00.14)
Minoru Shiraishi : A monkey can't... 	(0:21:03.22)
Akira Kogami : It's time to say goodbye! 	(0:21:08.39)
Akira Kogami : When you are happy... 	(0:21:10.52)
Akira Kogami : ...time really goes by quickly, right? 	(0:21:11.98)
Akira Kogami : And so... 	(0:21:14.32)
Akira Kogami : ...send us all sorts of questions and praise for me... 	(0:21:15.32)
Akira Kogami : ...as well as your opinion for the show, please☆! 	(0:21:18.50)
Minoru Shiraishi : We'll see you next time. 	(0:21:20.82)
Akira Kogami : See you! 	(0:21:22.74)
Akira Kogami : So yeah. 	(0:21:25.70)
Akira Kogami : What were the regulars like? 	(0:21:26.54)
Minoru Shiraishi : What do you mean? 	(0:21:28.12)
Akira Kogami : So...how do i put it... 	(0:21:29.62)
Akira Kogami : Is anyone's going to get knocked off? 	(0:21:31.13)
Akira Kogami : Don't they all hate each other or something? 	(0:21:32.71)
Minoru Shiraishi : No... 	(0:21:34.85)
Minoru Shiraishi : I don't think that's the case... 	(0:21:35.51)
Akira Kogami : Then how about you be considerate- 	(0:21:37.17)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Kona-chan, you're amazing! 	(0:21:41.21)
Miyuki Takara : You were very passionate. 	(0:21:43.05)

Konata Izumi : There's anime stuff along with the SFX stuff. 	(0:21:48.34)
Kagami Hiiragi : That's not what I meant! 	(0:21:50.45)
Kagami Hiiragi : Sing something the rest of us know! 	(0:21:52.40)
Konata Izumi : We're free to sing whatever we want. 	(0:21:55.29)

Kagami Hiiragi : Here's the remote. 	(0:21:58.03)
Kagami Hiiragi : Come on, Tsukasa. 	(0:21:59.36)
Kagami Hiiragi : If you don't order a song... 	(0:22:00.45)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...we'll end up listening to her endless medley of anime songs. 	(0:22:01.41)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I'm actually okay with that. 	(0:22:04.91)
Miyuki Takara : This is fun in its own way. 	(0:22:06.89)
Kagami Hiiragi : Even you, Miyuki?! 	(0:22:08.83)
Konata Izumi : Sorry if I block anyone's view. 	(0:22:10.93)
Konata Izumi : I'm gonna stand this time. 	(0:22:12.00)
Kagami Hiiragi : What are you up to now? 	(0:22:13.21)
Konata Izumi : If you don't stand up when you sing... 	(0:22:14.88)
Konata Izumi : ...your voice can't really come out. 	(0:22:16.05)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're gonna sing even louder?! 	(0:22:18.38)
Konata Izumi : Actual footage from the show! 	(0:22:22.57)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : This is kinda amazing! 	(0:22:24.19)
Kagami Hiiragi : Looks like it was made way before we were born. 	(0:22:25.45)
Minoru Shiraishi : Here are your drinks! 	(0:22:47.24)
Kagami Hiiragi : Thanks. 	(0:22:49.95)
Minoru Shiraishi : Who ordered the oolong tea? 	(0:22:53.74)
Kagami Hiiragi : That's me. 	(0:22:55.37)
Minoru Shiraishi : The iced lemon tea? 	(0:22:56.63)
Miyuki Takara : That would be mine. 	(0:22:58.25)
Minoru Shiraishi : The orange juice? 	(0:22:59.38)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Over here. 	(0:23:01.00)
Minoru Shiraishi : The ginger ale? 	(0:23:01.92)
Kagami Hiiragi : Sorry. 	(0:23:04.38)
Kagami Hiiragi : Could you just set it over there? 	(0:23:05.26)
EXTRA : Well, next time on Lucky Star: 	(0:23:10.97)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'm Kagami. 	(0:23:14.40)
Kagami Hiiragi : When you buy juice from a vending machine... 	(0:23:15.27)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...and put in a 200 yen coin and get back a 50 yen coin and a 10 yen coin as change... 	(0:23:16.94)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...it's like, "I win"! 	(0:23:19.86)
Kagami Hiiragi : But when you ride the train... 	(0:23:21.15)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...and try to buy a 150 yen ticket... 	(0:23:22.36)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...and put in a 100 yen coin thinking that you have five 10 yen coins... 	(0:23:23.99)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...but once you put in four, you find out you're short one. 	(0:23:26.78)
Kagami Hiiragi : Since you have no choice, you put in another 100 yen coin... 	(0:23:29.45)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...and thus get back nine 10 yen coins... 	(0:23:31.45)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...and that sense of defeat is really something! 	(0:23:33.50)
Kagami Hiiragi : Next time: 	(0:23:35.96)
Kagami Hiiragi : All Kinds of People. 	(0:23:36.54)
EXTRA : Look forward to it. 	(0:23:37.95)
Kagami Hiiragi : Oh, yeah... 	(0:01:30.88)
Kagami Hiiragi : We switch to summer uniforms today. 	(0:01:32.07)
Kagami Hiiragi : Someone like Konata will probably show up in her winter uniform. 	(0:01:34.34)
Kagami Hiiragi : There's always at least one person in every class that forgets. 	(0:01:37.72)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Onee-chan, good morning. 	(0:01:41.22)
Kagami Hiiragi : There's one so close to me. 	(0:01:48.77)
Kagami Hiiragi : Oh no! 	(0:01:53.59)
Kagami Hiiragi : I forgot to apply for the TV giveaway. 	(0:01:55.11)
Kagami Hiiragi : Bah. 	(0:01:58.61)
Kagami Hiiragi : I kinda wanted the prize. 	(0:01:59.32)
Kagami Hiiragi : An apron from Apron of Love. 	(0:02:00.86)
Konata Izumi : You just didn't have enough love. 	(0:02:02.10)
Konata Izumi : You didn't have enough love, so you forgot. 	(0:02:04.91)
Kagami Hiiragi : Not really. 	(0:02:07.75)
Kagami Hiiragi : More like I've been busy with student council stuff and tests. 	(0:02:08.54)
Konata Izumi : Nope, nope. 	(0:02:12.50)
Konata Izumi : Those are just excuses. 	(0:02:13.21)
Konata Izumi : I've never forgotten. 	(0:02:15.26)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't put me on the same level as someone who only thinks about having fun! 	(0:02:17.17)
Kagami Hiiragi : Or rather, the way you phrased it really pisses me off! 	(0:02:20.18)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : How do you win those giveaways? 	(0:02:22.89)
Konata Izumi : To put it simply... 	(0:02:25.56)
Konata Izumi : Love! 	(0:02:26.58)
Kagami Hiiragi : Yeah, yeah. 	(0:02:28.25)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'm just a woman with no love. 	(0:02:29.23)
Konata Izumi : Well... 	(0:02:31.56)
Konata Izumi : If you send in a normal postcard... 	(0:02:32.15)
Konata Izumi : ...you'll lose even if you had a chance of winning. 	(0:02:33.36)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Kona-chan, what do you put on yours? 	(0:02:35.90)
Konata Izumi : Stuff that'll help me win. 	(0:02:37.78)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : How? 	(0:02:39.55)
Konata Izumi : Neat handwriting is the most basic of fundamentals. 	(0:02:40.86)
Konata Izumi : You have to design a postcard that just begs to be drawn. 	(0:02:43.41)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Like what? 	(0:02:47.74)
Konata Izumi : Like... 	(0:02:48.59)
Konata Izumi : Use a highlighter to draw a border around the postcard. 	(0:02:50.26)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That'll stand out. 	(0:02:54.42)
Konata Izumi : Furthermore, you add an illustration with a motif of the present you want. 	(0:02:56.34)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : An illustration, huh? 	(0:03:00.40)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I don't think i can draw very well though. 	(0:03:03.14)
Konata Izumi : In that case... 	(0:03:04.89)
Konata Izumi : ...just send in as many entries as you can. 	(0:03:06.76)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I can probably handle that. 	(0:03:10.83)
Konata Izumi : But... 	(0:03:12.06)
Konata Izumi : No matter how many you send... 	(0:03:13.02)
Konata Izumi : ...write each one out by hand without using a printer. 	(0:03:15.31)
Konata Izumi : And send out a hundred each time. 	(0:03:20.07)
Kagami Hiiragi : A hundred?! 	(0:03:21.82)
Konata Izumi : A hundred is like normal. 	(0:03:22.86)
Kagami Hiiragi : Wouldn't that cost a lot? 	(0:03:24.91)
Konata Izumi : You're fighting for something you want. 	(0:03:26.66)
Konata Izumi : That calls for both passion and investment! 	(0:03:29.08)
Kagami Hiiragi : But wouldn't sometimes it be cheaper to just buy it? 	(0:03:31.69)
Konata Izumi : There are things in this world that money can't buy. 	(0:03:34.42)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Can you fit a hundred postcards in a mailbox? 	(0:03:38.38)
Konata Izumi : You don't send them all at once... 	(0:03:40.51)
Konata Izumi : ...but a few here and a few there. 	(0:03:42.99)
Konata Izumi : And over the course of a few days. 	(0:03:45.80)
Konata Izumi : When you have a lot of cards at once... 	(0:03:48.54)
Konata Izumi : ...the chooser might shove all of them aside. 	(0:03:51.39)
Konata Izumi : Well, sometimes you're better off without the tricky stuff. 	(0:03:53.94)
Konata Izumi : And sometimes it's the exact opposite. 	(0:03:57.27)
Kagami Hiiragi : So what do we do? 	(0:03:58.96)
Konata Izumi : Like I said... 	(0:04:00.48)
Konata Izumi : Love! 	(0:04:01.36)
Kagami Hiiragi : Yeah, yeah. 	(0:04:01.90)
Konata Izumi : Anyway, if you want to win something... 	(0:04:02.94)
Konata Izumi : ...glance through free newspapers and flyers... 	(0:04:04.91)
Konata Izumi : ...and look for drawings that probably aren't going to attract many people. 	(0:04:08.07)
Konata Izumi : You'll have a high chance of winning. 	(0:04:12.12)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I'll give it a try! 	(0:04:14.92)
Kagami Hiiragi : Where's the love in that? 	(0:04:15.87)
Konata Izumi : Kagami and Tsukasa... 	(0:04:21.00)
Konata Izumi : ...even though you are twins, you don't look alike. 	(0:04:22.53)
Kagami Hiiragi : That's because we're fraternal twins. 	(0:04:25.97)
Kagami Hiiragi : So it's more like comparing ordinary sisters. 	(0:04:28.62)
Kagami Hiiragi : Identical twins look exactly the same... 	(0:04:31.72)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...but fraternal twins can be... 	(0:04:34.02)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...pretty different in appearance and personality. 	(0:04:35.27)
Konata Izumi : I see. 	(0:04:37.46)
Konata Izumi : It's true that Tsukasa is so laid back... 	(0:04:38.81)
Konata Izumi : ...but Kagami is vicious. 	(0:04:40.94)
Kagami Hiiragi : What was that?! 	(0:04:41.94)
Konata Izumi : If you had the same hairstyles with the same ribbons... 	(0:04:43.61)
Konata Izumi : ...you might end up looking the same. 	(0:04:45.84)
Kagami Hiiragi : Kona-chan! 	(0:04:48.03)
Konata Izumi : No good. 	(0:04:49.95)
Konata Izumi : Kagami could never be the kawaii type. 	(0:04:50.45)
Kagami Hiiragi : Shut up! 	(0:04:51.87)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't insult me with your weird fantasies! 	(0:04:52.74)
Konata Izumi : Do you have something like telepathy? 	(0:04:55.62)
Konata Izumi : You know. 	(0:04:58.08)
Konata Izumi : With twins... 	(0:04:58.60)
Konata Izumi : Even when they're raised separately... 	(0:04:59.75)
Konata Izumi : ...they end up having similar lifestyles and lovers. 	(0:05:01.63)
Konata Izumi : And sometimes they end up marrying another pair of twins. 	(0:05:06.53)
Konata Izumi : And when one of them is in danger... 	(0:05:08.89)
Konata Izumi : ...the other one can sense it from a completely different place. 	(0:05:11.01)
Konata Izumi : There are all kinds of mysterious phenomena. 	(0:05:15.06)
Konata Izumi : So can't you use telepathy? 	(0:05:17.39)
Konata Izumi : Give it a try. 	(0:05:19.48)
Konata Izumi : Like, beep-beep. 	(0:05:20.77)
Kagami Hiiragi : That's just you reading too much manga. 	(0:05:21.31)
Konata Izumi : Same with ManaKana... 	(0:05:23.30)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ManaKana? 	(0:05:24.80)
Konata Izumi : I heard that they have a few differences. 	(0:05:26.09)
Konata Izumi : By the way, Mana is the careful one... 	(0:05:29.45)
Konata Izumi : ...and Kana is the optimistic one. 	(0:05:31.95)
Konata Izumi : And apparently they sound a little different when they sing. 	(0:05:33.66)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That reminds me... 	(0:05:37.21)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ManaKana thought they were fraternal twins for a long time... 	(0:05:38.21)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...but they recently learned that they were actually identical twins. 	(0:05:42.42)
Kagami Hiiragi : Seriously?! 	(0:05:46.17)
Konata Izumi : Is it really that surprising? 	(0:05:47.34)
Kagami Hiiragi : The definitions for identical and fraternal twins... 	(0:05:49.13)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...had been changed recently. 	(0:05:51.34)
Konata Izumi : Which means that you two could be identical twins. 	(0:05:53.12)
Konata Izumi : Your identical traits would be... 	(0:05:57.18)
Konata Izumi : You both like sweets, right? 	(0:06:00.52)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Love them. 	(0:06:03.19)
Kagami Hiiragi : I guess. 	(0:06:04.07)
Konata Izumi : You're both left-handed. 	(0:06:04.98)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That's right. 	(0:06:07.32)
Konata Izumi : What's your favorite color? 	(0:06:08.40)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : White, I guess. 	(0:06:09.70)
Kagami Hiiragi : Black. 	(0:06:10.61)
Konata Izumi : The same colors as your souls. 	(0:06:11.32)
Kagami Hiiragi : What was that?! 	(0:06:13.16)
Konata Izumi : All this talk about eggs and sausage has made me hungry. 	(0:06:18.21)
Kagami Hiiragi : Nobody was talking about food. 	(0:06:22.08)
Konata Izumi : It's suffocating in here. 	(0:06:30.34)
Kagami Hiiragi : We end up sweating as soon as it gets a little crowded. 	(0:06:32.55)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It's that time of year. 	(0:06:34.97)
Konata Izumi : Hot... 	(0:06:37.20)
Kagami Hiiragi : They haven't turned on the air conditioning yet. 	(0:06:38.93)
Kagami Hiiragi : H-Hey! 	(0:06:46.02)
Konata Izumi : Hot... 	(0:06:47.01)
Konata Izumi : Ladybug Samba, punk version. 	(0:06:49.99)
Konata Izumi : One of my relatives is getting married this month. 	(0:06:55.95)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Ah, a June bride! 	(0:07:01.04)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Sounds wonderful. 	(0:07:02.83)
Konata Izumi : How does this... 	(0:07:03.88)
Konata Izumi : ...wet and gloomy season supposedly signify happiness? 	(0:07:05.50)
Miyuki Takara : Why does getting married in June make you happy? 	(0:07:12.88)
Miyuki Takara : The name June... 	(0:07:17.31)
Miyuki Takara : ...is generally said to be... 	(0:07:19.64)
Miyuki Takara : ...derived from the name of the Roman goddess, Juno. 	(0:07:21.35)
Miyuki Takara : In Greek mythology... 	(0:07:23.98)
Miyuki Takara : ...Juno is known as Hera... 	(0:07:24.86)
Miyuki Takara : ...the goddess of marriage and fertility. 	(0:07:27.30)
Miyuki Takara : Which is why those who get married in Hera's month, the month of June... 	(0:07:29.94)
Miyuki Takara : ...are said to receive her protection and blessing. 	(0:07:33.78)
Konata Izumi : But wasn't Hera Zeus's wife? 	(0:07:37.41)
Miyuki Takara : Yes, that's right. 	(0:07:40.02)
Konata Izumi : I have this image of Hera being extremely jealous... 	(0:07:41.79)
Konata Izumi : ...so I'm not feeling this happy thing. 	(0:07:44.88)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What? 	(0:07:48.13)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : For your wedding, would you rather wear a dress or a kimono? 	(0:07:49.00)
Miyuki Takara : I would like to wear a dress. 	(0:07:52.42)
Miyuki Takara : It's been my dream since I was little. 	(0:07:54.55)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I'd also go with a dress. 	(0:07:58.22)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : But a kimono would also be nice... 	(0:08:00.35)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I think I'd like to wear both! 	(0:08:04.23)
Miyuki Takara : They have miniskirts and really colorful dresses these days. 	(0:08:06.52)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : A miniskirt wedding dress? 	(0:08:10.94)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It'd look really cute with lots of frills on them. 	(0:08:12.69)
Konata Izumi : Lots of dreams! 	(0:08:16.36)
Konata Izumi : Lots of frills! 	(0:08:17.57)
Konata Izumi : Right? 	(0:08:18.81)
Konata Izumi : Tsukasa is like Angel Salvia. 	(0:08:20.08)
Konata Izumi : Wait. 	(0:08:22.08)
Konata Izumi : Your hair makes you look more like Daisy. 	(0:08:22.66)
Konata Izumi : So a yellow top and miniskirt it is. 	(0:08:25.54)
Miyuki Takara : Tsukasa-san. 	(0:08:30.17)
Miyuki Takara : You'd probably look good in a miniskirt. 	(0:08:31.05)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Really? 	(0:08:32.67)
Konata Izumi : Your dress is important... 	(0:08:33.67)
Konata Izumi : ...but the person you're getting married to is also important. 	(0:08:34.84)
Konata Izumi : A childhood friend? 	(0:08:37.64)
Konata Izumi : Or a rich lady? 	(0:08:39.26)
Konata Izumi : It's hard to decide on which one. 	(0:08:40.93)
Konata Izumi : One has lots of money... 	(0:08:43.00)
Konata Izumi : ...and the ability to cast Beho*mi and l***zun. 	(0:08:45.02)
Konata Izumi : But, feelings wise... 	(0:08:48.86)
Kagami Hiiragi : Bianca, no doubt about it! 	(0:08:50.09)
Konata Izumi : Oh, Kagami. 	(0:08:51.76)
Konata Izumi : You're much more pure than I thought. 	(0:08:53.11)
Konata Izumi : I thought you'd go for the money. 	(0:08:54.61)
Kagami Hiiragi : No comeback, huh? 	(0:08:57.11)
Kagami Hiiragi : Yo, Konata. 	(0:09:01.20)
Kagami Hiiragi : I've got a question about a game I borrowed the other day. 	(0:09:03.62)
Konata Izumi : Oh. 	(0:09:06.67)
Konata Izumi : Hold it right there, Kagaminya. 	(0:09:07.29)
Konata Izumi : Isn't it more fun when you figure it out yourself? 	(0:09:09.02)
Kagami Hiiragi : You have a point. 	(0:09:13.42)
Konata Izumi : Yep, yep. 	(0:09:14.59)
Kagami Hiiragi : Since you understand that you should do things yourself... 	(0:09:15.32)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...you'll do your own homework from now on, right? 	(0:09:18.70)
Konata Izumi : Don't the detectives in manga and TV shows... 	(0:09:23.10)
Konata Izumi : ...run into an awful lot of murders? 	(0:09:25.48)
Konata Izumi : Like in Conan or Kindaichi. 	(0:09:28.65)
Kagami Hiiragi : There wouldn't be a story otherwise. 	(0:09:30.56)
Konata Izumi : Really? 	(0:09:33.53)
Konata Izumi : Couldn't they just solve normal cases? 	(0:09:34.32)
Kagami Hiiragi : Normal? 	(0:09:36.44)
Konata Izumi : Like travel around Japan in search of a missing person . 	(0:09:37.30)
Konata Izumi : Tailing people has a highly game like aspect. 	(0:09:41.58)
Konata Izumi : With plenty of thrill and suspense. 	(0:09:44.41)
Kagami Hiiragi : I guess. 	(0:09:46.58)
Konata Izumi : You could also conduct investigations into unfaithful wives. 	(0:09:47.73)
Kagami Hiiragi : Or look for pets that ran away? 	(0:09:51.17)
Konata Izumi : Yep, yep! 	(0:09:53.00)
Kagami Hiiragi : But would that be fun to watch? 	(0:09:54.32)
Konata Izumi : Probably no fun at all. 	(0:09:57.63)
Kagami Hiiragi : Right? 	(0:09:59.68)
Konata Izumi : Also... 	(0:10:00.32)
Konata Izumi : Cases in real life... 	(0:10:01.51)
Konata Izumi : ...don't really use any brilliant tricks... 	(0:10:02.97)
Konata Izumi : ...like the ones you find in manga and TV shows. 	(0:10:05.89)
Kagami Hiiragi : I guess not. 	(0:10:08.77)
Konata Izumi : Like faking a fingerprint, or fabricating something... 	(0:10:10.15)
Konata Izumi : ...or eliminating Luminol reaction. 	(0:10:12.80)
Konata Izumi : Stuff that's a step ahead of forensic labs. 	(0:10:14.57)
Kagami Hiiragi : Well... 	(0:10:17.07)
Kagami Hiiragi : Anything too good might lead to copycats. 	(0:10:17.97)
Kagami Hiiragi : Or be too sensitive for broadcast. 	(0:10:20.36)
Konata Izumi : Ah, or that... 	(0:10:22.37)
Konata Izumi : The really hard cases end without anyone realizing they happened or go... 	(0:10:23.68)
Konata Izumi : ...unsolved. 	(0:10:28.00)
Kagami Hiiragi : That's a risky line in all sorts ways! 	(0:10:28.66)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Don't you hate how it's been constantly raining the past few days? 	(0:10:32.25)
Konata Izumi : You're right... 	(0:10:34.96)
Konata Izumi : And I used to like rain... 	(0:10:38.55)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You get soaked... 	(0:10:42.55)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...and you can't hang clothes out to dry... 	(0:10:44.05)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...so I've never really liked it. 	(0:10:45.89)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Why did you like rain, Kona-chan? 	(0:10:48.18)
Konata Izumi : Because baseball games would be cancelled and I'd get to watch anime. 	(0:10:50.35)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I see. 	(0:10:55.15)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Sounds just like something you would say. 	(0:10:56.36)
Konata Izumi : They have a lot more dome stadiums now. 	(0:10:58.21)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Is something wrong? 	(0:11:05.80)
Konata Izumi : You often see idiots and geniuses going to the same school in anime... 	(0:11:07.22)
EXTRA : That's enough outta you! 	(0:11:13.52)
EXTRA : Shut up! 	(0:11:14.77)
EXTRA : Gourds at the top of the vine should stay out! 	(0:11:15.85)
Konata Izumi : When you think about it, isn't that actually kinda strange? 	(0:11:18.06)
Kagami Hiiragi : If you put it that way... 	(0:11:20.53)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...in some recent anime... 	(0:11:21.82)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...the teacher looks the same age as the students. 	(0:11:23.07)
Kagami Hiiragi : Or even younger. 	(0:11:27.12)
EXTRA : Sensei. 	(0:11:28.83)
EXTRA : Yes, Ta*****na-san? 	(0:11:29.87)
Konata Izumi : The world's always been interested in watching... 	(0:11:31.49)
Konata Izumi : ...the gap between physical age and mental age. 	(0:11:35.17)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't get it. 	(0:11:38.59)
Konata Izumi : You shouldn't question it. 	(0:11:39.54)
Konata Izumi : In fact, wouldn't a student who's really different from everyone else... 	(0:11:42.21)
Konata Izumi : ...be the real mystery? 	(0:11:45.18)
Kagami Hiiragi : Yeah. 	(0:11:48.93)
Kagami Hiiragi : I really have to agree on that part. 	(0:11:49.76)
Kagami Hiiragi : I shouldn't be saying this... 	(0:11:52.47)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...but I don't know how Konata got into this school. 	(0:11:54.14)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're good at cramming the night before... 	(0:11:56.98)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...so maybe you did the same for your entrance exam? 	(0:11:58.69)
Kagami Hiiragi : What? 	(0:12:05.86)
Kagami Hiiragi : Is that really the case? 	(0:12:06.22)
Konata Izumi : Nah. 	(0:12:07.84)
Konata Izumi : Well, I couldn't have pulled it off in one night. 	(0:12:08.32)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That gave me a scare. 	(0:12:11.12)
Kagami Hiiragi : But I'm impressed that you actually kept studying. 	(0:12:12.49)
Kagami Hiiragi : Did a quiz game come out for DS or something? 	(0:12:15.18)
Konata Izumi : My otou-san set some conditions. 	(0:12:18.12)
Konata Izumi : A D-rank would mean a Pippin. 	(0:12:20.84)
Konata Izumi : A C-rank would mean a 3DO. 	(0:12:22.17)
Konata Izumi : A B-rank would mean a PS2. 	(0:12:23.78)
Kagami Hiiragi : Izumi's dad... 	(0:12:25.84)
Kagami Hiiragi : You really know how to deal with your daughter, huh? 	(0:12:26.84)
Konata Izumi : I've been wondering... 	(0:12:29.59)
Konata Izumi : Isn't the real mystery how Tsukasa's in the same school as us? 	(0:12:36.18)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You said it without even blinking! 	(0:12:39.31)
Konata Izumi : Woo-hoo! 	(0:12:43.70)
EXTRA : Come back in ten years! 	(0:12:44.25)
Konata Izumi : I won again! 	(0:12:44.92)
Kagami Hiiragi : Damn it! 	(0:12:45.08)
Kagami Hiiragi : I can't beat her at fighting games. 	(0:12:45.97)
Kagami Hiiragi : She's spent way more time on them than I have. 	(0:12:47.70)
Konata Izumi : Challenge to me a different game if you want. 	(0:12:49.16)
Kagami Hiiragi : Sure about that? 	(0:12:53.24)
Kagami Hiiragi : Then next is... 	(0:12:54.54)
Kagami Hiiragi : A quiz game! 	(0:12:56.41)
Kagami Hiiragi : N-No way... 	(0:12:58.54)
Kagami Hiiragi : I lost to Konata in a game of knowledge? 	(0:12:59.62)
Kagami Hiiragi : Unbelievable... 	(0:13:02.42)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't tell me... 	(0:13:04.25)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...she memorized the question order? 	(0:13:05.18)
Konata Izumi : Humiliated. 	(0:13:06.64)
Kagami Hiiragi : Her memory's incredible when it comes to gaming. 	(0:13:07.72)
Konata Izumi : What should we play next? 	(0:13:11.14)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't be in such a hurry. 	(0:13:12.37)
Konata Izumi : Huh? That's weird. 	(0:13:14.43)
Konata Izumi : Didn't you have a really easy party game? 	(0:13:16.27)
Kagami Hiiragi : How do you know all the games I have? 	(0:13:19.52)
Konata Izumi : You could probably beat me at that one. 	(0:13:22.77)
Kagami Hiiragi : It just stunk! 	(0:13:26.57)
Konata Izumi : Kagami, you've barely eaten any snacks. 	(0:13:28.70)
Konata Izumi : Usually, you wolf them down. 	(0:13:31.70)
Kagami Hiiragi : There's no real reason for it. 	(0:13:33.70)
Konata Izumi : I know. 	(0:13:35.74)
Konata Izumi : Dieting for summer? 	(0:13:36.58)
Kagami Hiiragi : It's not like that. 	(0:13:38.75)
Konata Izumi : Not like you have anyone to show your swimsuit off to. 	(0:13:40.87)
Kagami Hiiragi : Shut it! 	(0:13:43.00)
Kagami Hiiragi : It's none of your business! 	(0:13:43.75)
Konata Izumi : Oh, yeah. 	(0:13:45.05)
Konata Izumi : Weren't you guys born on Tanabata? 	(0:13:45.71)
Konata Izumi : Isn't your birthday soon? 	(0:13:47.84)
Kagami Hiiragi : Yeah, so? 	(0:13:49.72)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Kona-chan, you remembered. 	(0:13:50.76)
Kagami Hiiragi : Seventeen, huh? 	(0:13:53.80)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Seventeen's right before the unlucky one. 	(0:13:55.31)
Konata Izumi : What does that mean? 	(0:13:57.47)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : In the year before a real unlucky year... 	(0:13:59.23)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...unlucky things begin to happen. 	(0:14:00.77)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : As my birthday approaches... 	(0:14:04.65)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...I'm getting worried... 	(0:14:06.82)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...so I bought a bunch of wards... 	(0:14:08.90)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...and power stones. 	(0:14:11.03)
Konata Izumi : That kinda sounds like fun. 	(0:14:13.41)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Sure is! 	(0:14:15.20)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I couldn't stop buying them. 	(0:14:16.41)
Kagami Hiiragi : And like... 	(0:14:18.16)
Kagami Hiiragi : We have wards against rage at our place. 	(0:14:19.00)
Kagami Hiiragi : Er, no. 	(0:14:20.66)
Kagami Hiiragi : All-purpose ward. 	(0:14:21.41)
Konata Izumi : Wards against rage, hah. 	(0:14:22.63)
Konata Izumi : Like... 	(0:14:25.04)
Konata Izumi : We ensure safe pregnancy and protect you from traffic accidents at the same time! 	(0:14:25.79)
Kagami Hiiragi : Yeah, yeah. 	(0:14:29.67)
Konata Izumi : Oh, yeah. 	(0:14:30.97)
Konata Izumi : Did you know that your birthday is Ponytail Day? 	(0:14:32.13)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I had no idea. 	(0:14:36.22)
Kagami Hiiragi : But why is it July 7th? 	(0:14:37.43)
Konata Izumi : It's said that Orihime from the Tanabata legend had a ponytail. 	(0:14:39.85)
Kagami Hiiragi : Sounds like a stretch. 	(0:14:43.69)
Konata Izumi : There's really a Japan Ponytail Society... 	(0:14:45.69)
Konata Izumi : ...and they give an award every year to a celebrity who they think would look good with a ponytail. 	(0:14:49.15)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Really... 	(0:14:55.41)
Kagami Hiiragi : But I have a feeling that anyone would look good with a ponytail. 	(0:14:56.70)
Konata Izumi : I wonder about that. 	(0:15:00.37)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : My hair's the shortest... 	(0:15:07.84)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...so it's barely a ponytail. 	(0:15:09.86)
Konata Izumi : But a small ponytail's pretty cute. 	(0:15:10.92)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Kona-chan, yours looks good too. 	(0:15:14.11)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You could go with that on an everyday basis. 	(0:15:15.97)
Konata Izumi : Think so? 	(0:15:18.68)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Sure. 	(0:15:20.77)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Onee-chan also... 	(0:15:27.36)
Konata Izumi : Kagami's is... 	(0:15:28.73)
Kagami Hiiragi : Fine! 	(0:15:29.77)
Kagami Hiiragi : I get the idea! 	(0:15:30.94)
Kagami Hiiragi : I should just take it off. 	(0:15:31.69)
Konata Izumi : All manly like a samurai. 	(0:15:33.57)
Kagami Hiiragi : Sorry about that! 	(0:15:34.99)
Konata Izumi : Don't drunks often wear ties around their heads? 	(0:15:37.82)
Konata Izumi : Is that supposed to mean something? 	(0:15:41.58)
Kagami Hiiragi : Oh, that? 	(0:15:43.50)
Kagami Hiiragi : Isn't that just when the guy loosens the tie... 	(0:15:44.75)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...and tries to pull it off over his head... 	(0:15:46.33)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...but it gets stuck? 	(0:15:48.34)
Kagami Hiiragi : In that case... 	(0:15:51.96)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...it's a lot weirder that they're always carrying a takeout box. 	(0:15:53.22)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Takeout box? 	(0:15:56.76)
Konata Izumi : The thing Kato-chan from the Drifters carries. 	(0:15:58.05)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I'm not getting it... 	(0:16:01.10)
Konata Izumi : Drunks these days... 	(0:16:02.66)
Konata Izumi : ...pretty much always have a tie around their head and a takeout box in their hand. 	(0:16:04.64)
Kagami Hiiragi : Right? 	(0:16:09.48)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I hope Orihime and Hikoboshi can see each other this year. 	(0:16:10.57)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Twinkle. Twinkle. Twinkle. 	(0:16:14.65)
Konata Izumi : Hope those rage wards of yours can deliver a miracle. 	(0:16:16.45)
Kagami Hiiragi : Mind your own business. 	(0:16:19.24)
Konata Izumi : They're giving away all varieties of QUO cards at Comp Festival. 	(0:16:21.66)
Kagami Hiiragi : Oh, yeah... 	(0:16:25.12)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're always collecting QUO cards... 	(0:16:25.96)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...but do you ever use them? 	(0:16:28.08)
Konata Izumi : I don't. 	(0:16:30.19)
Kagami Hiiragi : Then why spend the effort? 	(0:16:31.80)
Konata Izumi : Isn't it natural to want any item... 	(0:16:33.59)
Konata Izumi : ...related to a series you like? 	(0:16:35.76)
Konata Izumi : As a fan. As a collector. 	(0:16:37.76)
Kagami Hiiragi : Not really... 	(0:16:39.68)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...if you're never gonna use them... 	(0:16:40.72)
Konata Izumi : You can't use them! 	(0:16:42.01)
Konata Izumi : You have to take good care of them! 	(0:16:43.68)
Konata Izumi : It really pisses me off when I see someone use one. 	(0:16:45.39)
Konata Izumi : You're not supposed to use these things! 	(0:16:49.52)
Konata Izumi : Much less auction them off or sell them. 	(0:16:51.96)
Konata Izumi : If you do, of course you fail as a fan... 	(0:16:55.76)
Konata Izumi : ...but you also fail as a collector! 	(0:16:57.40)
Kagami Hiiragi : You say it so passionately, but... 	(0:17:00.24)
Konata Izumi : In my case, I need at least three. 	(0:17:02.28)
Konata Izumi : One for preservation. 	(0:17:05.75)
Konata Izumi : I keep it in a special case. 	(0:17:07.75)
Konata Izumi : Then one to take out occasionally to look at. 	(0:17:10.13)
Kagami Hiiragi : What's the last one for? 	(0:17:13.30)
Konata Izumi : An extra. 	(0:17:14.21)
Kagami Hiiragi : What's that? 	(0:17:14.96)
Konata Izumi : Don't you always want two or three of something you like? 	(0:17:15.88)
Konata Izumi : Yeah, yeah. 	(0:17:23.89)
Konata Izumi : You don't. 	(0:17:24.56)
Konata Izumi : I'm just a otaku. 	(0:17:25.39)
Konata Izumi : I'm strange. 	(0:17:26.98)
Kagami Hiiragi : No. 	(0:17:27.77)
Kagami Hiiragi : I kind of understand what you're saying. 	(0:17:28.48)
Konata Izumi : You'd expect Tsukasa to be popular with guys... 	(0:17:32.52)
Konata Izumi : ...but I've never heard anything like that. 	(0:17:34.82)
Kagami Hiiragi : Tsukasa's a little plain and doesn't really stand out. 	(0:17:37.69)
Konata Izumi : Isn't it because she's got a scary looking onee-chan always guarding her? 	(0:17:41.45)
Kagami Hiiragi : Did you say something? 	(0:17:43.99)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I'm not sure if I'm really plain... 	(0:17:45.70)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...or if it's more that Kona-chan and Yuki-chan are really unique. 	(0:17:47.66)
Konata Izumi : Miyuki-san knows all kinds of things. 	(0:17:50.50)
Konata Izumi : And she's pretty. 	(0:17:53.59)
Konata Izumi : Has a good figure. 	(0:17:54.36)
Konata Izumi : Wears glasses. 	(0:17:55.50)
Konata Izumi : Hates the dentist. 	(0:17:56.71)
Konata Izumi : Clumsy. 	(0:17:57.76)
Konata Izumi : Naturally clueless. 	(0:17:58.26)
Kagami Hiiragi : Hey now. 	(0:17:58.64)
Kagami Hiiragi : Isn't this getting a little weird? 	(0:17:59.40)
Kagami Hiiragi : But it's true that I haven't heard anything about Miyuki. 	(0:18:01.55)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Maybe it's because she's so pretty... 	(0:18:04.60)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...that everyone's afraid to approach her? 	(0:18:06.06)
Kagami Hiiragi : I doubt that. 	(0:18:07.52)
Kagami Hiiragi : She's kind... 	(0:18:09.02)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...and really good at helping others. 	(0:18:09.85)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That's true. 	(0:18:11.02)
Kagami Hiiragi : Maybe a lot of guys ask her out. 	(0:18:12.48)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : But she turns them down? 	(0:18:14.77)
Kagami Hiiragi : Turns them down, huh... 	(0:18:16.53)
Konata Izumi : Nah. 	(0:18:17.86)
Konata Izumi : Maybe she doesn't realize that they're asking her out. 	(0:18:18.44)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That's possible. 	(0:18:21.03)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Yuki-chan can be a little clueless... 	(0:18:22.66)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...so an indirect approach might not work. 	(0:18:24.66)
Kagami Hiiragi : Really, the boys in your class are hopeless. 	(0:18:27.01)
Kagami Hiiragi : Doesn't a single one of them have the guts... 	(0:18:30.75)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...to confess his passionate feelings to Miyuki? 	(0:18:32.96)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Guess not... 	(0:18:35.79)
Konata Izumi : We don't have enough maniacs in our class. 	(0:18:37.09)
Konata Izumi : Miyuki-san's type is usually a bigger hit with maniacs. 	(0:18:40.63)
Kagami Hiiragi : Maniacs, huh? 	(0:18:45.51)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Right? 	(0:18:47.97)
Miyuki Takara : Oh. 	(0:18:48.89)
Miyuki Takara : It's already this late. 	(0:18:49.52)
Miyuki Takara : I'll need to excuse myself. 	(0:18:51.73)
Kagami Hiiragi : Really? 	(0:18:53.94)
Miyuki Takara : Please continue to enjoy yourselves. 	(0:18:55.15)
Miyuki Takara : Then I'll excuse myself. 	(0:18:59.32)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : See you later! 	(0:19:01.61)
Konata Izumi : Later! 	(0:19:02.82)
Konata Izumi : Anyway... 	(0:19:06.03)
Konata Izumi : Going on with the story... 	(0:19:07.08)
Konata Izumi : ...that person was actually... 	(0:19:08.85)
Miyuki Takara : O-Oh? 	(0:19:11.46)
Miyuki Takara : I-I'm terribly sorry! 	(0:19:13.16)
Konata Izumi : Yay! 	(0:19:14.42)
Miyuki Takara : I-I'm sorry. 	(0:19:16.13)
Konata Izumi : Man, oh, man... 	(0:19:17.59)
Kagami Hiiragi : Doesn't that always happen? 	(0:19:19.05)
Kagami Hiiragi : I did it the other day. 	(0:19:20.76)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : So did I. 	(0:19:23.01)
Kagami Hiiragi : Everybody does it at least once. 	(0:19:24.43)
Kagami Hiiragi : Konata you've done it too right? 	(0:19:26.93)
Konata Izumi : Nope. 	(0:19:28.14)
Konata Izumi : That was definitely an element of moe! 	(0:19:29.56)
Konata Izumi : Miyuki-san. 	(0:19:32.98)
Konata Izumi : Good job! 	(0:19:34.36)
Akira Kogami : Morning luckies! 	(0:19:40.82)
Akira Kogami : Okay! 	(0:19:42.32)
Akira Kogami : Today's another whoo-whoo happy episode of Lucky Channel! 	(0:19:43.03)
Akira Kogami : I'm your navigator, Kogami Akira. 	(0:19:46.70)
Akira Kogami : And... 	(0:19:48.78)
Minoru Shiraishi : Uh. 	(0:19:49.12)
Minoru Shiraishi : I'm Akira-sama's assistant, Shiraishi Minoru. 	(0:19:50.12)
Minoru Shiraishi : It's a pleasure. 	(0:19:52.87)
Akira Kogami : Okay, okay. 	(0:19:53.83)
Akira Kogami : The two of us have now done this show... 	(0:19:54.79)
Akira Kogami : Ta-da! 	(0:19:56.88)
Akira Kogami : Three times after today! 	(0:19:58.17)
Akira Kogami : How do you feel about it, Shiraishi-san? 	(0:19:59.79)
Akira Kogami : Have you gotten used to it? 	(0:20:01.38)
Minoru Shiraishi : Well... 	(0:20:02.55)
Minoru Shiraishi : Not yet... 	(0:20:03.22)
Minoru Shiraishi : So sorry. 	(0:20:04.47)
Akira Kogami : It feels like Shiraishi-san hasn't opened up to me yet. 	(0:20:06.22)
Akira Kogami : And it looks like we're sitting further apart than usual. 	(0:20:11.35)
Akira Kogami : Maybe this is the distance between our hearts... 	(0:20:14.06)
Akira Kogami : Sob. 	(0:20:16.44)
Minoru Shiraishi : Th-Th-That's not true! 	(0:20:17.56)
Minoru Shiraishi : Shuffle. 	(0:20:19.52)
Akira Kogami : Okay! 	(0:20:20.09)
Akira Kogami : I'd like to start with a twinkle again today! 	(0:20:20.90)
Akira Kogami : Um... 	(0:20:23.53)
Akira Kogami : We've got something the fans will love today! 	(0:20:24.24)
Akira Kogami : Can you believe it? 	(0:20:27.20)
Akira Kogami : We'll be doing our first introduction for a member of the regular cast! 	(0:20:28.20)
Minoru Shiraishi : Okay, uh... 	(0:20:32.58)
Minoru Shiraishi : We'll be introducing Takara Miyuki-san today. 	(0:20:33.45)
Akira Kogami : Let's see... 	(0:20:36.12)
Akira Kogami : The class representative, well-mannered, kn— 	(0:20:37.25)
Minoru Shiraishi : Knowledgeable. 	(0:20:41.59)
Akira Kogami : Knowledgeable... 	(0:20:42.63)
Akira Kogami : ...in both literary and culinary arts. A perfect person. 	(0:20:43.71)
Akira Kogami : Shiraishi-san. 	(0:20:46.26)
Akira Kogami : You know Miyuki-san, right? 	(0:20:47.13)
Minoru Shiraishi : But of course! 	(0:20:49.34)
Minoru Shiraishi : She's so wonderful, yeah? 	(0:20:51.10)
Minoru Shiraishi : First, there's her glasses! 	(0:20:52.76)
Minoru Shiraishi : And then she's really pretty. 	(0:20:54.35)
Minoru Shiraishi : With those looks... 	(0:20:56.06)
Minoru Shiraishi : ...you'd expect her to be hard to approach... 	(0:20:57.52)
Minoru Shiraishi : ...but she's actually a friendly person... 	(0:21:00.31)
Akira Kogami : I wish you'd talk that much on the radio show... 	(0:21:03.15)
Akira Kogami : You can't stop talking when it's about Miyuki-san. 	(0:21:07.40)
Minoru Shiraishi : No! 	(0:21:10.32)
Minoru Shiraishi : That's not it... 	(0:21:11.03)
Akira Kogami : Well, yeah. 	(0:21:12.30)
Akira Kogami : Takara Miyuki-san, is it? 	(0:21:13.37)
Akira Kogami : A pretty face. 	(0:21:15.25)
Akira Kogami : With large breasts. 	(0:21:16.62)
Akira Kogami : And other various elements of moe. 	(0:21:17.79)
Akira Kogami : Isn't she so lucky to be a pretty character? 	(0:21:19.69)
Minoru Shiraishi : Akira-sama, that's a little... 	(0:21:20.45)
Akira Kogami : The maniacs love her. 	(0:21:22.09)
Minoru Shiraishi : Uh, maniacs is a little... 	(0:21:23.68)
Akira Kogami : But you know... 	(0:21:23.96)
Akira Kogami : If it's maniacs you want, I'm a huge hit with those lolicons... 	(0:21:24.67)
Akira Kogami : Too bad! 	(0:21:27.76)
Akira Kogami : It's time to say goodbye! 	(0:21:29.43)
Akira Kogami : And so... 	(0:21:31.30)
Akira Kogami : In this segment we always seek questions and praise for me... 	(0:21:32.30)
Akira Kogami : ...as well as your opinions of the show, so send them please☆! 	(0:21:36.00)
Minoru Shiraishi : Please look forward to next time. 	(0:21:39.64)
Akira Kogami : See ya! 	(0:21:41.44)
Akira Kogami : So what's she really like? 	(0:21:43.98)
Minoru Shiraishi : Just like how i described her. 	(0:21:46.07)
Akira Kogami : No way! 	(0:21:47.15)
Akira Kogami : Doesn't she like smoke a pack at a time backstage? 	(0:21:48.20)
Minoru Shiraishi : No worry of that. She isn't you. 	(0:21:51.36)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That was fun! 	(0:21:57.33)
Miyuki Takara : A unique song. 	(0:21:58.73)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'd like to hear a song that normal people can enjoy already. 	(0:22:00.46)
Konata Izumi : You know the next one, Kagami. 	(0:22:04.17)
Konata Izumi : Guess it from the intro! 	(0:22:06.71)
Kagami Hiiragi : It's not another weird song, is it? 	(0:22:08.47)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What was this song again? 	(0:22:14.60)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't know... 	(0:22:15.81)
Konata Izumi : Kagami. 	(0:22:16.97)
Konata Izumi : The answer is... 	(0:22:17.64)
Kagami Hiiragi : It's from Full Metal! 	(0:22:19.56)
Konata Izumi : And it's Kagami's favorite... 	(0:22:22.15)
Konata Izumi : Fumoffu! 	(0:22:24.27)
Miyuki Takara : Really... 	(0:22:25.36)
Kagami Hiiragi : I-I just read the novels a bit... 	(0:22:26.48)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...and was only slightly hooked! 	(0:22:28.36)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You're really good, Kona-chan! 	(0:22:33.53)
Miyuki Takara : You can also sound like an adult. 	(0:22:35.08)
Kagami Hiiragi : Isn't she just doing an imitation? 	(0:22:37.33)
Kagami Hiiragi : So? 	(0:22:43.17)
Kagami Hiiragi : So, Tsukasa and Miyuki, what are you going to sing? 	(0:22:43.79)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I wonder if there's anything I can sing... 	(0:22:46.46)
Miyuki Takara : I don't know very many songs... 	(0:22:48.30)
Kagami Hiiragi : Anything works. 	(0:22:50.42)
Kagami Hiiragi : Konata's like that... 	(0:22:51.90)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...so we should sing what we want too. 	(0:22:53.09)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Um... 	(0:22:55.87)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Then I'll have a look. 	(0:22:56.58)
Miyuki Takara : I'm not very confident about my singing... 	(0:22:58.14)
Kagami Hiiragi : It's fine. 	(0:23:00.39)
Kagami Hiiragi : We're the only ones who'll hear you. 	(0:23:01.81)
Kagami Hiiragi : Just take it easy. 	(0:23:03.44)
Miyuki Takara : Is that so? 	(0:23:04.94)
Miyuki Takara : In that case... 	(0:23:06.48)
EXTRA : Well, next time on Lucky Star: 	(0:23:25.96)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I'm Tsukasa. 	(0:23:28.17)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Guess what? 	(0:23:29.02)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I laughed so hard the other day that I couldn't breathe. 	(0:23:29.63)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Then at school one morning... 	(0:23:33.59)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I'm already out of time? 	(0:23:34.64)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Next time: 	(0:23:36.18)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Motivation Issues. 	(0:23:36.80)
EXTRA : Look forward to next time! 	(0:23:37.85)
Nanako Kuroi : Okay. 	(0:01:35.67)
Nanako Kuroi : Who can solve this one? 	(0:01:36.34)
Nanako Kuroi : Shiraishi. 	(0:01:38.59)
Minoru Shiraishi : You just called on me! 	(0:01:39.88)
Nanako Kuroi : Really? 	(0:01:41.80)
Nanako Kuroi : Then Izumi. 	(0:01:43.21)
Nanako Kuroi : Izumi? 	(0:01:45.26)
Konata Izumi : No, I wasn't asleep. 	(0:01:47.64)
Nanako Kuroi : I didn't say anything yet. 	(0:01:50.10)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I forgot my English textbook! 	(0:01:58.15)
Konata Izumi : Why don't you go borrow Kagami's? 	(0:02:00.78)
Konata Izumi : They already had English, right? 	(0:02:02.74)
Kagami Hiiragi : Honestly... 	(0:02:05.03)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're so careless. 	(0:02:06.04)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Thank you! 	(0:02:08.21)
Kagami Hiiragi : You should double-check everything the day before. 	(0:02:09.79)
Konata Izumi : Tsukasa tends to forget stuff a lot, right? 	(0:02:12.66)
Kagami Hiiragi : Come to think of it... 	(0:02:16.08)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...Konata doesn't forget stuff like textbooks often. 	(0:02:17.76)
Konata Izumi : That's because I'm surprisingly diligent about those things. 	(0:02:20.92)
Konata Izumi : Plus, I never take my textbooks home in the first place. 	(0:02:24.59)
Kagami Hiiragi : Oh, is that so? 	(0:02:28.01)
Kagami Hiiragi : That's not called diligent at all! 	(0:02:29.23)
Kagami Hiiragi : But you can't review what we went over in class without a textbook. 	(0:02:31.14)
Konata Izumi : I never study at home. 	(0:02:35.19)
Kagami Hiiragi : Since you end up cramming the night before... 	(0:02:37.74)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : But Kona-chan's good at putting off stuff till the night before. 	(0:02:41.74)
Konata Izumi : That could be why I forget to do my homework. 	(0:02:45.65)
Kagami Hiiragi : You don't forget to do it. 	(0:02:49.07)
Kagami Hiiragi : You just don't want to do it. 	(0:02:51.67)
Konata Izumi : So show me your homework for Japanese this afternoon. 	(0:02:53.41)
Kagami Hiiragi : Already at it again, huh? 	(0:02:56.84)
Kagami Hiiragi : I've been thinking... 	(0:02:58.37)
Kagami Hiiragi : Miyuki's in your class... 	(0:02:59.84)
Kagami Hiiragi : Ask her to show you her homework. 	(0:03:01.34)
Konata Izumi : How should I put this... 	(0:03:03.42)
Konata Izumi : Miyuki-san's such a nice person... 	(0:03:05.26)
Konata Izumi : ...that it ends up being hard to ask her for anything... 	(0:03:06.89)
Konata Izumi : You know what I mean? 	(0:03:09.98)
Konata Izumi : There's this sensation you get. 	(0:03:11.44)
Kagami Hiiragi : I get what you're saying... 	(0:03:13.14)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...but I still can't accept it. 	(0:03:14.94)
Nanako Kuroi : Izumi. 	(0:03:16.77)
Nanako Kuroi : Izumi? 	(0:03:18.18)
Nanako Kuroi : What? She's late? 	(0:03:20.69)
Konata Izumi : Stop! 	(0:03:22.26)
Konata Izumi : I'm not late! 	(0:03:23.20)
Konata Izumi : I was late because I had to help someone! 	(0:03:25.28)
Konata Izumi : I usually go around with this guy... 	(0:03:28.32)
Konata Izumi : ...but I just couldn't get away today! 	(0:03:30.79)
Konata Izumi : He was like it's okay, we can split up... 	(0:03:34.28)
Konata Izumi : ...but the other five of us had gotten one... 	(0:03:36.82)
Konata Izumi : ...and he was the odd one out... 	(0:03:38.59)
Konata Izumi : ...which kinda left a bad feeling. 	(0:03:40.34)
Konata Izumi : When you've been in the same party for a long time, you wanna help each other out. 	(0:03:42.17)
Konata Izumi : So we all backed him up. 	(0:03:46.47)
Konata Izumi : Yeah, friends are a beautiful thing. 	(0:03:48.31)
Nanako Kuroi : Really... 	(0:03:50.88)
Nanako Kuroi : So you were up all night playing online games again. 	(0:03:52.02)
Nanako Kuroi : Kept playing after I logged off, huh? 	(0:03:56.01)
Nanako Kuroi : Izumi. 	(0:03:58.25)
Nanako Kuroi : Izumi? 	(0:03:59.68)
Nanako Kuroi : What? She's late? 	(0:04:02.19)
Konata Izumi : Stop! 	(0:04:03.72)
Konata Izumi : I'm not late! 	(0:04:04.70)
Konata Izumi : This girl crashed into me in the shopping district. 	(0:04:06.39)
Konata Izumi : Then she suddenly grabbed my hand and took off running. 	(0:04:09.45)
Konata Izumi : Eventually, I learned that she'd stolen some taiyaki... 	(0:04:12.41)
Konata Izumi : ...and was on the run... 	(0:04:15.29)
Konata Izumi : I was wondering what any of this had to do with me... 	(0:04:16.81)
Konata Izumi : ...but I had no choice but to duck into a café to hide from the taiyaki baker. 	(0:04:19.80)
Nanako Kuroi : So many potential comebacks... 	(0:04:24.50)
Nanako Kuroi : But I can't! 	(0:04:26.51)
Nanako Kuroi : As a teacher! 	(0:04:28.51)
Nanako Kuroi : As a human being! 	(0:04:29.30)
Konata Izumi : I'm down with a summer cold. 	(0:04:31.37)
Nanako Kuroi : Izumi. 	(0:04:34.57)
Nanako Kuroi : What's wrong? 	(0:04:35.54)
Konata Izumi : Teacher, I'm terribly sorry... 	(0:04:37.47)
Konata Izumi : ...but I need to take a sick day... 	(0:04:39.19)
Nanako Kuroi : Hey, now. 	(0:04:41.73)
Nanako Kuroi : Too much gaming again? 	(0:04:42.74)
Nanako Kuroi : The same trick won't work every time. 	(0:04:44.49)
Konata Izumi : No, I'm sick... 	(0:04:47.32)
Nanako Kuroi : Let me guess. You've got a summer cold, right? 	(0:04:50.74)
Nanako Kuroi : Winter's over and the weather's nice... 	(0:04:53.75)
Nanako Kuroi : ...so stop being lazy and get to class! 	(0:04:56.19)
Konata Izumi : So she totally treated me like the boy who cried wolf yesterday. 	(0:05:03.42)
Kagami Hiiragi : You reap what you sow. 	(0:05:07.76)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Are you okay now? 	(0:05:09.85)
Konata Izumi : It looks like my fever broke... 	(0:05:12.14)
Konata Izumi : ...but my throat still hurts. 	(0:05:13.81)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That means you breathe through your mouth. 	(0:05:16.55)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Huh? 	(0:05:20.87)
Kagami Hiiragi : Well... 	(0:05:21.82)
Kagami Hiiragi : You can also breathe through your mouth... 	(0:05:22.52)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...but wouldn't you usually breathe through your nose? 	(0:05:24.65)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : No... 	(0:05:26.20)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : But Kona-chan breathes through her mouth more than her nose. 	(0:05:26.86)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Because... 	(0:05:31.15)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You know? 	(0:05:31.95)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : If a virus enters through your mouth, you get a throat infection. 	(0:05:32.37)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : And if a virus enters through your nose, you get a nasal infection. 	(0:05:35.79)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : So people with sore throats probably had a higher chance of a virus entering through their throat... 	(0:05:39.04)
Konata Izumi : This is when we turn to Miyuki-san. 	(0:05:46.58)
Kagami Hiiragi : Yeah... 	(0:05:48.80)
Konata Izumi : Huh? 	(0:05:49.64)
Konata Izumi : So hot... 	(0:05:52.21)
Konata Izumi : Don't feel like doing anything... 	(0:05:54.72)
Konata Izumi : Kagami? 	(0:05:59.14)
Konata Izumi : About your birthday party today... 	(0:06:00.40)
Konata Izumi : How about we hold it at my place? 	(0:06:01.79)
Konata Izumi : It's so hot that I can't move a step. 	(0:06:03.67)
Kagami Hiiragi : We're baking cookies right now. 	(0:06:07.77)
Konata Izumi : I'll go. 	(0:06:12.07)
Kagami Hiiragi : Hurry it up. 	(0:06:13.44)
Konata Izumi : Welcome! 	(0:06:15.15)
Konata Izumi : Happy birthday! 	(0:06:16.36)
Konata Izumi : Tsukasa and other. 	(0:06:18.04)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't abbreviate me off! 	(0:06:19.33)
Miyuki Takara : Happy birthday. 	(0:06:20.62)
Miyuki Takara : Kagami-san and Tsukasa-san. 	(0:06:23.34)
Kagami Hiiragi : Thanks! 	(0:06:26.41)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Thank you! 	(0:06:27.97)
Miyuki Takara : And it isn't much... 	(0:06:29.71)
Miyuki Takara : ...but I have presents for you. 	(0:06:32.43)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'm so excited! 	(0:06:33.45)
Miyuki Takara : Open it up. 	(0:06:34.81)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Matching earrings! 	(0:06:38.39)
Miyuki Takara : I considered a number of options... 	(0:06:40.97)
Miyuki Takara : ...but I had a hard time making up my mind. 	(0:06:42.86)
Konata Izumi : And here are presents from me! 	(0:06:44.68)
Kagami Hiiragi : Oh, joy. 	(0:06:48.19)
Konata Izumi : Open it up. 	(0:06:49.19)
EXTRA : [Caption: Chief] 	(0:06:51.17)
Kagami Hiiragi : What is this? 	(0:06:52.89)
Konata Izumi : Brigade chief armband. 	(0:06:54.53)
Konata Izumi : Try it on. 	(0:06:56.04)
Kagami Hiiragi : Why should I put this on?! 	(0:06:57.27)
Konata Izumi : I figured it would fit you perfectly. 	(0:07:00.78)
Kagami Hiiragi : It would go better on you. 	(0:07:04.54)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Um... 	(0:07:06.16)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Then what is this... 	(0:07:06.92)
Konata Izumi : It cost a fortune... 	(0:07:09.90)
Konata Izumi : Wear it with care. 	(0:07:11.99)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't try to make both of us cosplay! 	(0:07:13.67)
Konata Izumi : It's barely any different from our uniform. 	(0:07:16.47)
Miyuki Takara : That's quite a problem. 	(0:07:20.39)
Miyuki Takara : If it's too big... 	(0:07:21.85)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Right? 	(0:07:23.19)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Just sucks. 	(0:07:23.77)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : And it stinks. 	(0:07:24.69)
Kagami Hiiragi : Hey. 	(0:07:27.31)
Kagami Hiiragi : It's our birthday. 	(0:07:28.28)
Kagami Hiiragi : You could hold back a little. 	(0:07:29.65)
Konata Izumi : Tsukasa's cookies are always so good. 	(0:07:31.56)
Kagami Hiiragi : I baked them with her this time. 	(0:07:35.90)
Kagami Hiiragi : Kinda learned as I went. 	(0:07:38.90)
Kagami Hiiragi : What's wrong? 	(0:07:41.78)
Konata Izumi : Now that I think about it... 	(0:07:43.41)
Konata Izumi : ...some of these cookies don't taste as good as the others. 	(0:07:44.54)
Konata Izumi : Weird, isn't it? 	(0:07:47.25)
Kagami Hiiragi : What was that?! 	(0:07:48.38)
Konata Izumi : Wonder if this is one of Kagami's. 	(0:07:49.83)
Kagami Hiiragi : Might as well eat the cake, too. 	(0:07:52.46)
Konata Izumi : Kagamin – works hard only on her birthday. 	(0:07:55.05)
Kagami Hiiragi : Zip it. 	(0:07:58.85)
Konata Izumi : By the way... 	(0:08:01.47)
Konata Izumi : ...isn't there always a fight over how to cut the cake? 	(0:08:02.48)
Kagami Hiiragi : Why? 	(0:08:05.51)
Konata Izumi : You know. 	(0:08:06.34)
Konata Izumi : When you cut a cake into a bunch of slices... 	(0:08:07.44)
Konata Izumi : ...how do you divide up the strawberries on top... 	(0:08:09.42)
Konata Izumi : ...or decide who gets the chocolate decorations? 	(0:08:11.88)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : My older sisters all love chocolate. 	(0:08:14.52)
Kagami Hiiragi : Rats... 	(0:08:20.82)
Kagami Hiiragi : I was off. 	(0:08:21.62)
Konata Izumi : Wouldn't expect that from Kagamin. 	(0:08:23.44)
Kagami Hiiragi : What are you talking about?! 	(0:08:25.35)
Konata Izumi : Itadaki masu! 	(0:08:26.93)
Miyuki Takara : Itadaki masu. 	(0:08:28.72)
Kagami Hiiragi : What? 	(0:08:37.50)
Kagami Hiiragi : My strawberry's awfully small. 	(0:08:40.95)
Kagami Hiiragi : What is it? 	(0:08:46.76)
Kagami Hiiragi : Do I have cake on my face? 	(0:08:48.06)
Konata Izumi : I just discovered another facet of Kagamin's charm. 	(0:08:50.11)
Kagami Hiiragi : You sound just like Shin-chan, so stop it. 	(0:08:54.03)
Kagami Hiiragi : It's almost summer break. 	(0:08:56.69)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That's right. 	(0:08:59.48)
Kagami Hiiragi : The beach, the pool, and summer festivals... 	(0:09:01.08)
Kagami Hiiragi : Are there any other usual events? 	(0:09:03.54)
Konata Izumi : Twitch. 	(0:09:05.81)
Konata Izumi : Summer is all about the annual celebration! 	(0:09:06.32)
Konata Izumi : The beginning of the battle! 	(0:09:08.69)
Konata Izumi : The one and only... 	(0:09:11.00)
Konata Izumi : Comiket! 	(0:09:12.42)
Kagami Hiiragi : No, no, no, no, no. 	(0:09:14.37)
Kagami Hiiragi : That only applies to you. 	(0:09:15.67)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Is that like cricket? 	(0:09:17.09)
Kagami Hiiragi : W-Well... 	(0:09:18.38)
Kagami Hiiragi : Everyone has their own different thing to do. 	(0:09:19.60)
Kagami Hiiragi : Like visiting relatives or something. 	(0:09:22.39)
Miyuki Takara : Good morning. 	(0:09:23.77)
Kagami Hiiragi : Miyuki... 	(0:09:26.39)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...do you have some kind of regular summer activity? 	(0:09:27.64)
Miyuki Takara : Let's see... 	(0:09:30.27)
Miyuki Takara : I'll be taking a vacation overseas again this year. 	(0:09:32.43)
Kagami Hiiragi : Again? 	(0:09:36.86)
Kagami Hiiragi : She said again? 	(0:09:37.86)
Kagami Hiiragi : Stupid bourgeois! 	(0:09:38.78)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Is that like yogurt? 	(0:09:40.07)
Kagami Hiiragi : You said that you started working at a cosplay café... 	(0:09:41.99)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't you need a good figure to pull that off? 	(0:09:45.00)
Konata Izumi : Man... 	(0:09:49.00)
Konata Izumi : I've been lamenting my lack of a chest for a while... 	(0:09:49.96)
Konata Izumi : ...but then this game said... 	(0:09:53.71)
Konata Izumi : "A flat chest is a status symbol! 	(0:09:54.96)
Konata Izumi : A rarity!" 	(0:09:56.76)
Konata Izumi : Word for word. 	(0:09:58.34)
Konata Izumi : And when you think about it... 	(0:10:01.30)
Konata Izumi : ...there is a demand, right? 	(0:10:02.30)
Konata Izumi : Which means I'm valuable! 	(0:10:05.00)
Kagami Hiiragi : I want to know how a line from a game can fill her with confidence. 	(0:10:06.54)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Then I guess I'm okay, too. 	(0:10:10.35)
Kagami Hiiragi : Honestly... 	(0:10:12.25)
Kagami Hiiragi : We have a test coming up. 	(0:10:13.32)
Kagami Hiiragi : Should you be gaming so much? 	(0:10:15.07)
Kagami Hiiragi : If you would only use some of that passion for studying... 	(0:10:18.44)
Kagami Hiiragi : Your grades would probably go up. 	(0:10:21.70)
Kagami Hiiragi : If she's so easily influenced... 	(0:10:26.20)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...wouldn't she become a genius if someone released a game that promoted studying? 	(0:10:28.54)
Kagami Hiiragi : There's already stuff like Moe Drill. 	(0:10:32.74)
Konata Izumi : Something wrong? 	(0:10:35.28)
Kagami Hiiragi : There's been a lot of juvenile crimes lately. 	(0:10:36.67)
Konata Izumi : Whenever that happens... 	(0:10:39.75)
Konata Izumi : ...all the neighbors say... 	(0:10:42.05)
Konata Izumi : He was such a nice boy. 	(0:10:43.73)
Konata Izumi : I never would have imagined that he could do such a thing. 	(0:10:45.14)
Kagami Hiiragi : Well... 	(0:10:48.27)
Kagami Hiiragi : That just means you can't judge a person on the surface. 	(0:10:48.98)
Kagami Hiiragi : If you ever commit a crime... 	(0:10:54.89)
Kagami Hiiragi : I always figured she would do something like this. 	(0:10:57.40)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'll tell the whole world. 	(0:11:00.69)
Konata Izumi : Tired... 	(0:11:05.43)
Konata Izumi : It's so hot that I don't feel like doing anything. 	(0:11:07.95)
Kagami Hiiragi : I really understand how you feel... 	(0:11:11.95)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...but you never feel like doing anything. 	(0:11:15.37)
Konata Izumi : Hello, Kagami. 	(0:11:31.22)
Kagami Hiiragi : Yo. 	(0:11:33.27)
Kagami Hiiragi : Making progress on your studying for the test? 	(0:11:34.36)
Konata Izumi : I was tidying up my room. 	(0:11:37.73)
Konata Izumi : You know how kinda get the urge to start cleaning when you're feeling the pressure? 	(0:11:40.26)
Kagami Hiiragi : I can understand... 	(0:11:45.12)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...but study. 	(0:11:46.20)
Konata Izumi : Okay! 	(0:11:47.90)
Konata Izumi : Let's get a little studying done today! 	(0:11:48.77)
Konata Izumi : I'll take a thirty minute break. 	(0:11:56.62)
Konata Izumi : I'm losing my concentration. 	(0:11:59.00)
Konata Izumi : Time's already up. 	(0:12:06.46)
Konata Izumi : Just thirty more minutes. 	(0:12:09.33)
Konata Izumi : Thirty more minutes... 	(0:12:10.79)
Konata Izumi : Isn't Haruhi about to start? 	(0:12:18.98)
Konata Izumi : They definitely cut corners with those long-winded Nagato scenes. 	(0:12:25.05)
Konata Izumi : That Ya***** hasn't been very impressive recently. 	(0:12:29.90)
Konata Izumi : They're already flaming away. 	(0:12:38.29)
Konata Izumi : It's already two? 	(0:12:42.62)
Konata Izumi : Not going to happen today. 	(0:12:43.97)
Konata Izumi : I'll go to sleep and wake up early to study. 	(0:12:46.05)
Konata Izumi : If I wake up at five... 	(0:12:50.22)
Konata Izumi : ...I can sleep three hours. 	(0:12:52.21)
Konata Izumi : I ended up killing time yesterday by reading manga and watching anime. 	(0:13:10.99)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Sounds like something you would do. 	(0:13:16.00)
Kagami Hiiragi : Come to think of it... 	(0:13:17.99)
Kagami Hiiragi : You sure have some odd taste in manga and games. 	(0:13:19.00)
Kagami Hiiragi : You only read shounen manga... 	(0:13:22.71)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...and mainly play dating sims. 	(0:13:24.28)
Konata Izumi : My otou-san reads manga and plays games a lot... 	(0:13:25.74)
Konata Izumi : ...so I was probably influenced. 	(0:13:29.51)
Konata Izumi : I've been watching him from the side since I was little. 	(0:13:31.72)
Kagami Hiiragi : I can understand the manga... 	(0:13:34.51)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...but playing dating sims in front of your daughter? 	(0:13:36.39)
Kagami Hiiragi : What kind of father is he? 	(0:13:39.06)
Konata Izumi : Doesn't your okaa-san have anything to say... 	(0:13:41.73)
Konata Izumi : ...with both of you like this? 	(0:13:43.36)
Konata Izumi : I don't have an okaa-san. 	(0:13:46.10)
Konata Izumi : She died when I was really little. 	(0:13:49.23)
Kagami Hiiragi : Really... 	(0:13:53.24)
Konata Izumi : So I'm always doing housework... 	(0:13:55.11)
Konata Izumi : ...which is why I'm way better than Kagami is. 	(0:13:57.46)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't say stuff like that... 	(0:13:59.66)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...when the mood isn't right for comebacks. 	(0:14:01.54)
Konata Izumi : Tsukasa's also good at cooking, right? 	(0:14:03.50)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I'm not sure if I would say that I'm good... 	(0:14:05.92)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...but I love it! 	(0:14:08.18)
Konata Izumi : I wonder how good Miyuki-san is. 	(0:14:08.95)
Konata Izumi : She looks rich... 	(0:14:11.68)
Konata Izumi : ...so maybe she's bad at housework. 	(0:14:12.97)
Miyuki Takara : Cooking, is it? 	(0:14:16.26)
Miyuki Takara : To be honest... 	(0:14:18.09)
Miyuki Takara : I only help out from time to time... 	(0:14:19.35)
Miyuki Takara : ...so I'm not very skilled at housework. 	(0:14:22.15)
Miyuki Takara : It's quite embarrassing. 	(0:14:25.28)
Konata Izumi : Oh! Knew it! 	(0:14:26.78)
Kagami Hiiragi : But Miyuki's so good at everything else... 	(0:14:28.86)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...that it doesn't really feel the same. 	(0:14:31.28)
Kagami Hiiragi : You can't just assume that she's bad when she says so. 	(0:14:32.91)
Konata Izumi : I see... 	(0:14:37.11)
Miyuki Takara : No, not at all... 	(0:14:38.08)
Konata Izumi : Then what about our teacher? 	(0:14:39.74)
Konata Izumi : I heard that she lives by herself... 	(0:14:42.83)
Konata Izumi : ...but she looks like she could be a slob. 	(0:14:44.46)
Nanako Kuroi : These days... 	(0:14:48.42)
Nanako Kuroi : ...you can get by without knowing how to cook! 	(0:14:49.91)
Nanako Kuroi : Yo got your convenience stores. 	(0:14:52.80)
Nanako Kuroi : Just kidding! 	(0:14:55.80)
Nanako Kuroi : I can cook. 	(0:14:57.22)
Nanako Kuroi : About as well as your average person. 	(0:14:58.81)
Kagami Hiiragi : Please don't make jokes that sound like they're true. 	(0:15:01.10)
Kagami Hiiragi : Tsukasa still has my dictionary. 	(0:15:07.27)
Kagami Hiiragi : Tsukasa. 	(0:15:10.19)
Kagami Hiiragi : Sorry. Could I get my dictionary back? 	(0:15:11.16)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I-I was doing a little cleaning for a change of pace... 	(0:15:15.74)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...yeah... 	(0:15:19.20)
Kagami Hiiragi : You too, huh? 	(0:15:19.91)
Kagami Hiiragi : Yo. 	(0:15:22.74)
Kagami Hiiragi : What's up? 	(0:15:23.63)
Konata Izumi : The people at work are trying to come up with a new menu for summer. 	(0:15:25.04)
Kagami Hiiragi : So you do stuff like that, too... 	(0:15:30.71)
Kagami Hiiragi : And wait, did you give up on studying for the test? 	(0:15:32.43)
Konata Izumi : Spicy stuff's good when it's hot outside... 	(0:15:34.85)
Konata Izumi : ...so how about super spicy ramen?! 	(0:15:37.43)
Kagami Hiiragi : Go with something you would usually find in a café. 	(0:15:40.68)
Konata Izumi : Then a super spicy parfait! 	(0:15:43.75)
Kagami Hiiragi : Could you stop skipping the thinking process when you respond? 	(0:15:46.07)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I can't stand... 	(0:15:53.90)
Konata Izumi : Why doesn't our school have swimming class? 	(0:15:59.40)
Konata Izumi : We have a pool... 	(0:16:03.42)
Miyuki Takara : I'm actually relieved by that fact. 	(0:16:05.17)
Konata Izumi : Why's that? 	(0:16:09.00)
Miyuki Takara : To be honest... 	(0:16:10.09)
Miyuki Takara : I can't open my eyes underwater... 	(0:16:11.24)
Miyuki Takara : ...so I can't really swim. 	(0:16:13.59)
Miyuki Takara : It's quite embarrassing. 	(0:16:16.09)
Konata Izumi : Your weaknesses, each and every time, are so unfair! 	(0:16:17.46)
Konata Izumi : The summer Comp Festival is finally about to begin! 	(0:16:23.43)
Konata Izumi : That's right... 	(0:16:27.52)
Konata Izumi : This is why I started working... 	(0:16:29.02)
Konata Izumi : A festival... 	(0:16:33.10)
Konata Izumi : You bring so many fond memories! 	(0:16:34.74)
Kagami Hiiragi : Why are you pulling out an ancient reference? 	(0:16:37.49)
Konata Izumi : Man... 	(0:16:39.56)
Konata Izumi : When the customers start getting excited with you... 	(0:16:40.74)
Konata Izumi : ...doesn't it feel like everyone's pumped up together for the festival? 	(0:16:43.66)
Kagami Hiiragi : Use some of that passion on academic endeavors. 	(0:16:47.23)
Kagami Hiiragi : Having trouble getting to sleep. 	(0:16:56.59)
Kagami Hiiragi : Guess I'll read until I fall asleep. 	(0:16:58.58)
Kagami Hiiragi : I happen to have some stuff I just bought. 	(0:17:01.30)
Kagami Hiiragi : So much for falling asleep... 	(0:17:15.48)
Kagami Hiiragi : It's already morning. 	(0:17:16.84)
Kagami Hiiragi : And now... 	(0:17:18.94)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...I'm feeling really sleepy... 	(0:17:20.20)
Konata Izumi : Stare... 	(0:17:24.73)
Konata Izumi : I can understand turning off your phone around priority seats... 	(0:17:26.49)
Konata Izumi : Because of pacemakers and the like. 	(0:17:30.63)
Konata Izumi : But why do they ban cell phone use for the whole train? 	(0:17:33.50)
Kagami Hiiragi : Because... 	(0:17:37.55)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...you'll disturb other people when you talk? 	(0:17:38.51)
Konata Izumi : But you know... 	(0:17:42.72)
Konata Izumi : Aren't trains already noisy with people talking anyway? 	(0:17:43.93)
Konata Izumi : That includes men and women of all ages. 	(0:17:47.85)
Kagami Hiiragi : I guess that's true... 	(0:17:49.86)
Konata Izumi : Are you going to work at the temple for summer festivals like you did for New Year's? 	(0:17:53.69)
Kagami Hiiragi : Nah. 	(0:17:57.18)
Kagami Hiiragi : I don't work in the summer. 	(0:17:58.16)
Kagami Hiiragi : Oh, yeah... 	(0:18:02.42)
Kagami Hiiragi : It's getting to be that time of year. 	(0:18:03.33)
Konata Izumi : Huh? 	(0:18:05.54)
Konata Izumi : Weren't you on a diet? 	(0:18:06.29)
Kagami Hiiragi : Nah. 	(0:18:08.58)
Kagami Hiiragi : Maybe it's because of all the studying... 	(0:18:09.38)
Kagami Hiiragi : When I weighed myself yesterday, it was down. 	(0:18:11.50)
Kagami Hiiragi : So I figured it'd be okay. 	(0:18:14.46)
Konata Izumi : That was quick. 	(0:18:16.74)
Konata Izumi : And like, you're weak. 	(0:18:17.68)
Konata Izumi : Good morning! 	(0:18:20.25)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Kona-chan, good morning! 	(0:18:22.09)
Konata Izumi : Huh? 	(0:18:24.22)
Konata Izumi : What's wrong with Kagami? 	(0:18:25.10)
Kagami Hiiragi : Konata! 	(0:18:26.79)
Kagami Hiiragi : My weight already... 	(0:18:28.80)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...went all the way up in like the blink of an eye... 	(0:18:30.31)
Konata Izumi : It's 'cause you let go and started snacking again. 	(0:18:32.21)
Konata Izumi : And wasn't that a senryu? 	(0:18:35.86)
Kagami Hiiragi : I only... 	(0:18:42.67)
Kagami Hiiragi : I only ate a little... 	(0:18:43.43)
Konata Izumi : It's not like a kilo or two is going to affect how you look. 	(0:18:44.22)
Konata Izumi : Why do you get so excited and depressed over every kilogram? 	(0:18:48.79)
Konata Izumi : This is why women are hopeless. 	(0:18:54.87)
Kagami Hiiragi : Aren't you supposed to be a woman too? 	(0:18:57.34)
Akira Kogami : Morning luckies! 	(0:19:05.67)
Akira Kogami : This week, Lucky Channel has started up again! 	(0:19:07.46)
Akira Kogami : Has everyone been doing well? 	(0:19:10.94)
Akira Kogami : I'm Kogami Akira, always running at 120%! 	(0:19:13.06)
Akira Kogami : Today... 	(0:19:17.15)
Minoru Shiraishi : Nyoron! 	(0:19:17.51)
Minoru Shiraishi : Just kidding! 	(0:19:18.32)
Minoru Shiraishi : I'm the assistant, Shiraishi Minoru. 	(0:19:18.94)
Akira Kogami : Hey. 	(0:19:22.32)
Minoru Shiraishi : What? 	(0:19:23.53)
Akira Kogami : Don't interrupt me! 	(0:19:24.03)
Minoru Shiraishi : I'm sorry! 	(0:19:26.40)
Akira Kogami : This isn't a kid's errand... 	(0:19:27.83)
Akira Kogami : ...so learn the job already. 	(0:19:29.29)
Akira Kogami : Or do you want to quit this job that much? 	(0:19:31.52)
Minoru Shiraishi : I'm terribly sorry! 	(0:19:34.12)
Minoru Shiraishi : I'll work hard! 	(0:19:34.96)
Akira Kogami : Give it my all! 	(0:19:35.44)
Akira Kogami : Okay! 	(0:19:38.27)
Akira Kogami : Today... 	(0:19:39.11)
Akira Kogami : Ta-da! 	(0:19:40.18)
Akira Kogami : We have big news for everyone! 	(0:19:41.32)
Akira Kogami : Published in the November issue of Comptiq... 	(0:19:45.38)
Akira Kogami : Akira Fashion Project! 	(0:19:47.68)
Akira Kogami : I've already received this many postcards from everyone! 	(0:19:50.14)
Minoru Shiraishi : Uh. 	(0:19:54.19)
Minoru Shiraishi : I think there was another person involved in that project... 	(0:19:54.86)
Akira Kogami : Thanks for all the feedback! 	(0:19:59.44)
Akira Kogami : Akira's mammoth happy! 	(0:20:01.74)
Minoru Shiraishi : I don't think anyone's going to understand a joke from the eighties... 	(0:20:04.34)
Akira Kogami : Then I'll reveal the ideas that were selected after extensive review. 	(0:20:06.69)
Akira Kogami : Like this. 	(0:20:11.83)
Akira Kogami : Um... 	(0:20:12.87)
Akira Kogami : This is from Cherry-san in Satte, Saitama. 	(0:20:13.62)
Akira Kogami : Akira Fashion Project! 	(0:20:16.88)
Akira Kogami : Kagami-san's twintails look great on her. 	(0:20:20.62)
Akira Kogami : What if Akira-san also wore twintails? 	(0:20:23.80)
Minoru Shiraishi : Twintails, huh... 	(0:20:26.66)
Akira Kogami : Sounds— 	(0:20:27.87)
Akira Kogami : Wonderful! 	(0:20:29.04)
Akira Kogami : That's right. 	(0:20:30.33)
Akira Kogami : Long hair is the life of woman! 	(0:20:31.98)
Akira Kogami : And split it in two is like... 	(0:20:33.85)
Akira Kogami : ...giving it a very elegant look. 	(0:20:35.35)
Minoru Shiraishi : Doing it ot not... 	(0:20:38.71)
Minoru Shiraishi : Isn't it impossible with Akira-sama's hair length... 	(0:20:40.11)
Akira Kogami : But you know. 	(0:20:43.32)
Akira Kogami : It's not like long hair is always a good thing. 	(0:20:44.49)
Minoru Shiraishi : Akira-sama. 	(0:20:46.71)
Minoru Shiraishi : It's gonna show. 	(0:20:47.55)
Akira Kogami : It weighs a lot... 	(0:20:48.40)
Minoru Shiraishi : It's really gonna show. 	(0:20:48.96)
Akira Kogami : Like if you just twitch! 	(0:20:50.14)
Akira Kogami : It's a pain to maintain. 	(0:20:50.45)
Akira Kogami : And frankly, it isn't in fashion right now. 	(0:20:53.04)
Akira Kogami : Guys run their mouth off about liking long hair on women... 	(0:20:55.54)
Minoru Shiraishi : Uh. 	(0:20:58.22)
Akira Kogami : ...but do they have any idea how much time, effort, and money it takes to maintain? 	(0:20:58.54)
Minoru Shiraishi : You're talking about yourself now. 	(0:20:59.02)
Minoru Shiraishi : Uh... 	(0:21:01.11)
Minoru Shiraishi : You're not in character anymore. 	(0:21:01.69)
Minoru Shiraishi : You're no longer Akira-sama. 	(0:21:03.57)
Akira Kogami : And nobody ever notices your efforts... 	(0:21:03.59)
Minoru Shiraishi : Are you listening? 	(0:21:04.70)
Minoru Shiraishi : Hello? 	(0:21:05.66)
Akira Kogami : It's already time to say goodbye! 	(0:21:08.42)
Akira Kogami : As for what would Akira look like with twintails... 	(0:21:10.59)
Akira Kogami : You can find out more on our homepage or the radio show! 	(0:21:14.39)
Akira Kogami : Hope to see you! 	(0:21:18.40)
Akira Kogami : I'll be waiting for mail too! 	(0:21:19.71)
Akira Kogami : Mata neee~ 	(0:21:22.19)
Minoru Shiraishi : Then please look forward to next week. 	(0:21:22.46)
Akira Kogami : What was with the attitude earlier? 	(0:21:26.23)
Minoru Shiraishi : By attitude, you mean... 	(0:21:28.11)
Akira Kogami : Why did you keep cutting in? 	(0:21:28.99)
Akira Kogami : That upset about getting corrected in the beginning? 	(0:21:31.04)
Minoru Shiraishi : No! Just that... 	(0:21:33.45)
Minoru Shiraishi : ...I just wondering if anyone would recognize the Nori-P reference 	(0:21:34.50)
Akira Kogami : Ah, no. 	(0:21:39.01)
Minoru Shiraishi : Forgive me. 	(0:21:39.50)
Minoru Shiraishi : Why don't we start over again? 	(0:21:40.13)
Akira Kogami : You know? 	(0:21:41.42)
Minoru Shiraishi : Yes. 	(0:21:42.13)
Akira Kogami : I heard they're holding an audition for Shiraishi Minoru. 	(0:21:42.63)
Minoru Shiraishi : Seriously?! 	(0:21:44.47)
Minoru Shiraishi : This is the first I've heard about it! 	(0:21:45.26)
Akira Kogami : You can try out if you want. 	(0:21:46.11)
Minoru Shiraishi : Try out? Me? 	(0:21:47.01)
Akira Kogami : Good for you. 	(0:21:47.56)
Minoru Shiraishi : But I'm the actual person! 	(0:21:48.51)
Akira Kogami : What? 	(0:21:51.30)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You're amazing, Kona-chan! 	(0:21:55.49)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You can sing anything! 	(0:21:57.12)
Konata Izumi : As long as it's an anime song. 	(0:21:58.73)
Miyuki Takara : You can sing well... 	(0:22:00.69)
Miyuki Takara : ...in many different voices. 	(0:22:02.73)
Konata Izumi : Singing anime songs... 	(0:22:04.34)
Konata Izumi : ...is all about staying true to the original song. 	(0:22:07.47)
Kagami Hiiragi : Okay. 	(0:22:10.82)
Kagami Hiiragi : Guess I'll sing. 	(0:22:11.74)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Onee-chan, what are you gonna sing? 	(0:22:13.04)
Miyuki Takara : The title was displayed earlier... 	(0:22:14.76)
Miyuki Takara : ...but I didn't recognize it. 	(0:22:16.79)
Kagami Hiiragi : Miyuki, you don't know this? 	(0:22:18.83)
Konata Izumi : Guess you aren't any better. 	(0:22:21.22)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I've heard this before! 	(0:22:28.23)
Kagami Hiiragi : Weren't you watching the series with me a while ago? 	(0:22:29.64)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Really? 	(0:22:32.55)
Konata Izumi : I still prefer the movie. 	(0:22:33.68)
Kagami Hiiragi : Are you an old geezer or something? 	(0:22:35.62)
Konata Izumi : You're good. 	(0:22:46.94)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Onee-chan is the best singer among us siblings. 	(0:22:47.70)
EXTRA : Well, next time on Lucky Star: 	(0:23:24.85)
Miyuki Takara : I'm Miyuki. 	(0:23:27.09)
Miyuki Takara : Golden Week... 	(0:23:28.32)
Miyuki Takara : ...was apparently derived from industry lingo... 	(0:23:29.74)
Miyuki Takara : ...for the period when movie ticket sales are extremely high. 	(0:23:33.82)
Miyuki Takara : Next time: 	(0:23:36.22)
Miyuki Takara : Ace Shooter. 	(0:23:36.97)
EXTRA : Look forward to it! 	(0:23:38.14)
Nanako Kuroi : Tomorrow's the start of a long break... 	(0:01:31.44)
Nanako Kuroi : Don't forget that you're all students... 	(0:01:34.13)
Nanako Kuroi : ...and act with caution. 	(0:01:36.28)
EXTRA : Yes! 	(0:01:38.07)
Nanako Kuroi : Students feel restless around this time of year... 	(0:01:39.95)
Nanako Kuroi : ...and many cause societal disturbances. 	(0:01:41.79)
Nanako Kuroi : Sensei is terribly concerned. 	(0:01:45.67)
Nanako Kuroi : Take extreme care to avoid causing any trouble. 	(0:01:48.63)
Nanako Kuroi : In short... 	(0:01:53.54)
Nanako Kuroi : If you do something bad... 	(0:01:54.17)
Nanako Kuroi : ...it'll cut into sensei's vacation... 	(0:01:55.16)
Nanako Kuroi : ...so I'm begging you! 	(0:01:57.43)
Minoru Shiraishi : Sh-She's hopeless... 	(0:01:59.29)
Kagami Hiiragi : It's finally vacation... 	(0:02:04.30)
Kagami Hiiragi : When I think about how I won't have to see your face every day... 	(0:02:07.31)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...I feel so good. 	(0:02:10.32)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Onee-chan... 	(0:02:11.44)
Konata Izumi : Well, even if it is a vacation... 	(0:02:14.40)
Konata Izumi : ...I'll still see sensei every day. 	(0:02:15.70)
Kagami Hiiragi : Why? 	(0:02:19.30)
Kagami Hiiragi : Make-up classes or something? 	(0:02:20.16)
Konata Izumi : We're in the same party on a MMO. 	(0:02:21.49)
Kagami Hiiragi : What's up with that? 	(0:02:24.29)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : MMO? 	(0:02:25.71)
Konata Izumi : Sensei's a wiz, and I'm a tank. 	(0:02:26.75)
Konata Izumi : So if we pair up and I pull stuff... 	(0:02:29.25)
Konata Izumi : ...it's pretty good in terms of both xp and money. 	(0:02:30.75)
Kagami Hiiragi : Uh... 	(0:02:32.68)
Konata Izumi : Well, I'm the only one who's actually busy. 	(0:02:34.37)
Konata Izumi : All sensei has to do is click AoE spells. 	(0:02:36.63)
Konata Izumi : The other day, I pulled this huge mob... 	(0:02:40.43)
Konata Izumi : ...but sensei had fallen asleep... 	(0:02:43.43)
Konata Izumi : It took a whole day to earn my death penalty back. 	(0:02:45.27)
Kagami Hiiragi : Um... 	(0:02:47.73)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...can you at least speak in Japanese? 	(0:02:49.27)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Good morning. 	(0:02:53.94)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It sure is hot this morning. 	(0:02:55.74)
Kagami Hiiragi : Morning. 	(0:02:58.82)
Kagami Hiiragi : Your hair's quite amazing! 	(0:02:59.57)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Hey, Onee-chan. 	(0:03:01.28)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : How about we turn on the A/C? 	(0:03:02.37)
Kagami Hiiragi : There you go again... 	(0:03:03.70)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't be so quick to depend on that stuff. 	(0:03:05.12)
Kagami Hiiragi : Just use a fan or something, and bear with it. 	(0:03:07.33)
Kagami Hiiragi : Here. 	(0:03:09.46)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : A fan can make it pretty cool. 	(0:03:12.04)
Kagami Hiiragi : Right? 	(0:03:14.63)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I'm hot... 	(0:03:16.96)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You get tired from fanning yourself... 	(0:03:19.25)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...and once you stop, you feel even hotter than before, right? 	(0:03:21.30)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : When you use a fan... 	(0:03:23.47)
Kagami Hiiragi : Well, I knew that. 	(0:03:26.06)
Kagami Hiiragi : But try a little harder at least. 	(0:03:27.60)
Miyuki Takara : Everybody's wearing yukatas. 	(0:03:32.10)
Kagami Hiiragi : Well, our obis are the pre-tied ones. 	(0:03:35.77)
Kagami Hiiragi : The ones you can put on easily. 	(0:03:39.66)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Even then, yukatas sure are hard to put on. 	(0:03:41.24)
Kagami Hiiragi : Miyuki's obi is a real tied one, huh? 	(0:03:44.69)
Kagami Hiiragi : Just like you'd expect. 	(0:03:47.37)
Miyuki Takara : No. 	(0:03:49.04)
Miyuki Takara : A clerk at the store tied it for me. 	(0:03:49.75)
Miyuki Takara : Tying an obi would be too difficult for me. 	(0:03:52.92)
Kagami Hiiragi : I see. 	(0:03:56.67)
Kagami Hiiragi : And Konata's wearing one. 	(0:03:58.25)
Kagami Hiiragi : Oddly enough. 	(0:04:00.38)
Kagami Hiiragi : Did you also get yours tied at the store? 	(0:04:02.13)
Konata Izumi : Nope. 	(0:04:04.60)
Konata Izumi : My otou-san did it for me. 	(0:04:05.31)
Kagami Hiiragi : Oh, really... 	(0:04:08.97)
Konata Izumi : Come on, let's go! 	(0:04:10.23)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : How come her otou-san knows how to tie a sash? 	(0:04:14.27)
Yui Narumi : Hey! 	(0:04:19.52)
Yui Narumi : Konata-chan! 	(0:04:20.24)
Kagami Hiiragi : Someone from the police? 	(0:04:21.86)
Kagami Hiiragi : Do you know her? 	(0:04:23.12)
Konata Izumi : She's a relative of mine, Yui-nee san 	(0:04:24.45)
Yui Narumi : Nice ta meet you! 	(0:04:26.74)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Hi. 	(0:04:28.88)
Miyuki Takara : It's a pleasure to meet you. 	(0:04:28.91)
Kagami Hiiragi : It's a pleasure to meet you. 	(0:04:28.91)
Yui Narumi : Don't wreck too much havock. 	(0:04:31.16)
Yui Narumi : Listen to what these onee-sans say... 	(0:04:33.13)
Yui Narumi : ...and get home early. 	(0:04:35.34)
Kagami Hiiragi : No, no, no, no, no. 	(0:04:38.21)
Kagami Hiiragi : We're in the same year. 	(0:04:39.45)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't use Konata as the standard. 	(0:04:41.32)
Konata Izumi : We're all in the same year. 	(0:04:42.93)
Yui Narumi : What! 	(0:04:45.42)
Yui Narumi : Sorry, sorry. 	(0:04:46.22)
Yui Narumi : I'm amazed! 	(0:04:47.68)
Yui Narumi : The difference in size got me. 	(0:04:49.14)
Kagami Hiiragi : That's okay. 	(0:04:52.14)
Yui Narumi : Well... 	(0:04:52.73)
Yui Narumi : Girls sure hit puberty early these days. 	(0:04:54.06)
Kagami Hiiragi : No. 	(0:04:57.65)
Kagami Hiiragi : Like I said! 	(0:04:58.32)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't use Konata as the standard! 	(0:04:59.09)
Kagami Hiiragi : We're the normal ones! 	(0:05:00.71)
Konata Izumi : It's a shooting game. 	(0:05:03.48)
Konata Izumi : Yui-nee san 	(0:05:05.36)
Konata Izumi : Aren't you good at shooting games? 	(0:05:06.37)
Yui Narumi : Believe it or not... 	(0:05:10.97)
Yui Narumi : ...I'm good enough to be known as Sharpshooter Yui-chan. 	(0:05:12.37)
Yui Narumi : I can hit five bullseyes in three seconds. 	(0:05:15.50)
Yui Narumi : With enough time to flash a peace sign. 	(0:05:17.59)
Konata Izumi : Then try it out. 	(0:05:22.04)
Konata Izumi : Here. 	(0:05:23.47)
Yui Narumi : Huh? 	(0:05:24.47)
Yui Narumi : What? 	(0:05:24.97)
Yui Narumi : You use rifles for shooting games? 	(0:05:26.18)
Yui Narumi : What a surprise! 	(0:05:27.68)
Yui Narumi : I use pistols. 	(0:05:29.72)
Konata Izumi : Waku waku! Waku waku! 	(0:05:32.26)
EXTRA : Narumi. 	(0:05:43.15)
EXTRA : What are you so concentrated on over there? 	(0:05:44.15)

Yui Narumi : What? 	(0:05:46.95)
EXTRA : Okay, back to patrolling. 	(0:05:47.19)
Konata Izumi : Let's try this again... 	(0:05:51.20)
Konata Izumi : Onii-san. 	(0:05:53.03)
Konata Izumi : We can have anything over there if we hit it? 	(0:05:53.91)
EXTRA : Any of them all okay. 	(0:05:57.75)
Konata Izumi : Any of them? 	(0:06:00.25)

EXTRA : Whoa, ojou-chan! 	(0:06:06.59)
EXTRA : I'm not a prize. 	(0:06:07.97)
Konata Izumi : Summer festivals are all about shaved ice! 	(0:06:10.22)
Miyuki Takara : It's pretty hot. 	(0:06:13.31)
Kagami Hiiragi : Let's have some. 	(0:06:14.35)
Konata Izumi : Oh, yeah. 	(0:06:15.27)
Konata Izumi : I've been wondering... 	(0:06:16.19)
Konata Izumi : I know what strawberry, lemon, and melon are... 	(0:06:18.48)
Konata Izumi : ...but what kind of fruit is a Blue Hawaii? 	(0:06:22.07)
Konata Izumi : What does it taste like? 	(0:06:24.65)
Kagami Hiiragi : L-Like Blue Hawaii? 	(0:06:28.73)
Konata Izumi : That's right.. 	(0:06:31.29)
Konata Izumi : That's what you would think. 	(0:06:32.54)
Konata Izumi : So Miyuki-san... 	(0:06:35.03)
Konata Izumi : Do you know anything about Blue Hawaii? 	(0:06:36.71)
Miyuki Takara : Blue Hawaii, is it? 	(0:06:39.70)
Miyuki Takara : Um, let's see... 	(0:06:41.58)
Miyuki Takara : Is it a song? 	(0:06:43.87)
Miyuki Takara : B-Blue... 	(0:06:45.05)
Miyuki Takara : No, that's not it. 	(0:06:46.26)
Miyuki Takara : I'm not really sure. 	(0:06:48.92)
Miyuki Takara : I'm sorry I couldn't be of any help. 	(0:06:50.76)
Miyuki Takara : I'll look it up in the near future. 	(0:06:52.81)
Konata Izumi : I'm counting on you. 	(0:06:55.22)
Miyuki Takara : I don't believe there are any fruits or confections by that name. 	(0:06:56.73)
Kagami Hiiragi : Wait. 	(0:06:58.01)
Kagami Hiiragi : Shouldn't the person who wants to know... 	(0:06:58.69)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...be looking it up instead of Miyuki? 	(0:07:00.11)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Um... 	(0:07:02.86)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : About Blue Hawaii... 	(0:07:04.15)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I think the name comes from... 	(0:07:07.44)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...a cocktail with the same name and color. 	(0:07:09.11)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : The cocktail was named with the movie Blue Hawaii in mind. 	(0:07:12.41)
Miyuki Takara : You're right. 	(0:07:17.41)
Miyuki Takara : That was very informative. 	(0:07:19.21)
Konata Izumi : When you learn something from Tsukasa... 	(0:07:22.54)
Konata Izumi : ...it feels like you've really failed. 	(0:07:24.21)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I just realized that I barely have any money left. 	(0:07:29.04)
Kagami Hiiragi : The stuff at these stalls isn't cheap. 	(0:07:31.47)
Kagami Hiiragi : You have to think before you spend. 	(0:07:34.18)
Kagami Hiiragi : Geez! 	(0:07:36.39)
Konata Izumi : But the whole festival atmosphere makes you wanna spend. 	(0:07:39.10)
Kagami Hiiragi : I guess. 	(0:07:44.28)
Konata Izumi : It's like how you don't realize how expensive doujinshi is when you're at Comiket. 	(0:07:45.44)
Konata Izumi : Afterwards, you're like, "Whoa, I spent a lot." 	(0:07:49.90)
Kagami Hiiragi : Seriously, nobody else understands your world! 	(0:07:52.03)
Konata Izumi : You're all exhausted from waiting in line since morning... 	(0:07:55.08)
Konata Izumi : ...and it's really far between the west gate and east gate. 	(0:07:57.37)
Kagami Hiiragi : We don't know what you're talking about. 	(0:07:59.92)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I love how cotton candy is all fluffy and sweet! 	(0:08:02.49)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're not a child. 	(0:08:06.92)
Kagami Hiiragi : Calm down and eat. 	(0:08:08.92)
Konata Izumi : It's not as entertaining when two girls do it. 	(0:08:13.05)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't say it. 	(0:08:17.26)
Konata Izumi : Why haven't any of us found any romance? 	(0:08:19.05)
Konata Izumi : Summer means festivals which means yukatas! 	(0:08:22.93)
Konata Izumi : If this was a dating sim... 	(0:08:25.27)
Konata Izumi : ...you'd probably trigger at least one flag somewhere. 	(0:08:26.61)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Flag? 	(0:08:29.19)
Konata Izumi : And there'd be an event scene. 	(0:08:30.24)
Konata Izumi : Since you'd be in yukatas. 	(0:08:32.61)
Konata Izumi : And it's outdoors. 	(0:08:33.16)
Kagami Hiiragi : Okay, that's far enough. 	(0:08:34.33)
Miyuki Takara : Aren't you going to play anything, Kagami-san? 	(0:08:36.44)
Kagami Hiiragi : Since we're here... 	(0:08:39.97)
Kagami Hiiragi : Might as well scoop goldfish or something. 	(0:08:41.60)
Kagami Hiiragi : I haven't even made a move! 	(0:08:49.37)
Kagami Hiiragi : Why are they running away? 	(0:08:50.65)
Konata Izumi : Didn't they sense your barbaric nature and run away? 	(0:08:52.09)
Konata Izumi : Guess we've finally got some hard proof. 	(0:08:56.63)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Look! 	(0:09:02.47)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : There's one right here! 	(0:09:03.06)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're right. 	(0:09:05.14)
Kagami Hiiragi : Okay... 	(0:09:06.27)
Kagami Hiiragi : Gotcha! 	(0:09:08.10)
Kagami Hiiragi : Yay! 	(0:09:10.54)
Kagami Hiiragi : I caught one! 	(0:09:11.86)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That was amazing! 	(0:09:13.74)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'll take care of it. 	(0:09:17.53)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'll take good care of it. 	(0:09:19.86)
Kagami Hiiragi : Gyopi-chan. 	(0:09:22.12)
Nanako Kuroi : Yo. 	(0:09:25.46)
Nanako Kuroi : You're all together! 	(0:09:26.34)
Nanako Kuroi : I heard there was a festival around here... 	(0:09:27.75)
Nanako Kuroi : ...so I figured I might as well come. 	(0:09:30.42)
Nanako Kuroi : I love festivals. 	(0:09:32.72)
Konata Izumi : Did you come here together with your boyfriend or something? 	(0:09:34.54)
Nanako Kuroi : Of course not. 	(0:09:38.63)
Nanako Kuroi : Don't have one. 	(0:09:39.52)
Konata Izumi : There really isn't a shred of romance around us. 	(0:09:41.13)
Kagami Hiiragi : Figured as much. 	(0:09:45.60)
Yui Narumi : We meet again! 	(0:09:47.56)
Yui Narumi : Even more people? Looks like you're having fun. 	(0:09:48.98)
Nanako Kuroi : Hello. 	(0:09:51.52)
Yui Narumi : So this is the one who really hit puberty early, huh? 	(0:09:57.53)
Konata Izumi : She's our sensei. 	(0:10:01.24)
Konata Izumi : For homeroom. 	(0:10:02.08)
Yui Narumi : I'm terribly sorry. 	(0:10:02.87)
Yui Narumi : I assumed that you were a classmate. 	(0:10:04.21)
Nanako Kuroi : It's okay. 	(0:10:07.04)
Konata Izumi : A relative of mine, Yui-nee san. 	(0:10:08.29)
Konata Izumi : She's a cop. 	(0:10:10.13)
Konata Izumi : As you can see. 	(0:10:11.26)
Yui Narumi : Yeah... 	(0:10:12.67)
Yui Narumi : Today's a summer festival... 	(0:10:13.76)
Yui Narumi : ...so I'm on patrol here. 	(0:10:15.51)
Yui Narumi : Man, they make us work in such hot weather. 	(0:10:17.59)
Nanako Kuroi : Work? 	(0:10:20.67)
Nanako Kuroi : Looks like you're just having fun. 	(0:10:21.85)
Yui Narumi : Are you also working? 	(0:10:23.84)
Yui Narumi : Keeping an eye on students? 	(0:10:26.31)
Nanako Kuroi : Nah. 	(0:10:27.61)
Nanako Kuroi : I was bored so I figured I'd drop by. 	(0:10:28.56)
Yui Narumi : Lucky you. 	(0:10:30.52)
Yui Narumi : If I wasn't on duty... 	(0:10:31.73)
Yui Narumi : ...I would have come to play around. 	(0:10:32.99)
Nanako Kuroi : No. 	(0:10:36.86)
Nanako Kuroi : You're already having plenty of fun as it is! 	(0:10:37.36)
Nanako Kuroi : Are you also by yourself? 	(0:10:41.15)
Yui Narumi : Yes, I am. 	(0:10:43.25)
Nanako Kuroi : I see! 	(0:10:45.58)
EXTRA : Actually, I would recommend balsamic vinegar... 	(0:10:58.97)
EXTRA : But the normal vinegar you may have in your kitchen works fine. 	(0:11:01.72)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Balsamic vinegar. 	(0:11:04.48)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Balsamic vinegar. 	(0:11:06.55)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Balsamic vinegar! 	(0:11:09.10)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Summer vacations are kind of boring since you usually have nothing to do. 	(0:11:11.35)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You get used to sitting around and doing nothing. 	(0:11:16.36)
Kagami Hiiragi : If you're going to say that... 	(0:11:19.90)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...don't ask me to show you my homework later. 	(0:11:21.33)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I see. 	(0:11:26.70)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It sure is cute. 	(0:11:29.58)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : All stout and rotund. 	(0:11:31.46)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : And how the outside looks like a froggie. 	(0:11:33.84)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Yep, yep. 	(0:11:37.92)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Depleted uranium, huh? 	(0:11:41.34)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That's cool! 	(0:11:43.01)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I'll get in trouble if I'm on the phone too long. 	(0:11:46.80)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Bye, then! 	(0:11:51.56)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I was on the phone with Kona-chan... 	(0:11:54.94)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...and I mentioned how much free time we have during vacation... 	(0:11:56.61)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...but she's playing a bunch of games that have piled up, so she has no free time. 	(0:12:01.15)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I guess some people still enjoy a full and satisfying summer vacation. 	(0:12:05.77)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Maybe I should do something, too. 	(0:12:10.21)
Kagami Hiiragi : Well... 	(0:12:12.66)
Kagami Hiiragi : I suppose that's okay... 	(0:12:13.21)
Kagami Hiiragi : But do your homework! 	(0:12:15.40)
Kagami Hiiragi : Honestly... 	(0:12:18.30)
Kagami Hiiragi : Every single time... 	(0:12:19.17)
Konata Izumi : I'll pull one. 	(0:12:22.80)
Konata Izumi : Debuff please. 	(0:12:31.02)
Konata Izumi : Sensei logged on. 	(0:12:35.73)
Konata Izumi : You're on a lot more since it's vacation, huh? 	(0:12:42.88)
Konata Izumi : I've got some time. Wanna go hunting? 	(0:12:48.18)
Konata Izumi : I'm in the cave near Chopron Village. 	(0:12:50.40)
Konata Izumi : Then I'll be waiting by the gate. 	(0:12:55.35)
Konata Izumi : Sensei... 	(0:13:16.85)
Konata Izumi : Stop talking about real life everyday inside the net game world. 	(0:13:18.26)
Konata Izumi : It's like Kagami scolding me every day... 	(0:13:24.94)
Konata Izumi : Yo! 	(0:13:29.82)
Konata Izumi : Sure is hot today. 	(0:13:30.91)
Kagami Hiiragi : Welcome. 	(0:13:33.03)
Kagami Hiiragi : Come on in. 	(0:13:34.04)
Konata Izumi : Hello. 	(0:13:34.96)
Konata Izumi : You set up an electric fan. 	(0:13:39.92)
Kagami Hiiragi : Since it's hot. 	(0:13:42.25)
Kagami Hiiragi : Cool yourself down. 	(0:13:43.68)
Kagami Hiiragi : I knew it. 	(0:13:51.55)
Kagami Hiiragi : I knew you'd do it. 	(0:13:52.89)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Good morning. 	(0:13:55.06)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Kona-chan's here. 	(0:13:56.77)
Konata Izumi : Yo. 	(0:13:58.07)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't "good morning" me! 	(0:13:58.94)
Kagami Hiiragi : Do you have any idea what time it is? 	(0:14:00.69)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It sure is hot. 	(0:14:05.52)
Kagami Hiiragi : You too?! 	(0:14:10.45)
Konata Izumi : Well, it's the normal thing to do. 	(0:14:11.79)
Kagami Hiiragi : It isn't. 	(0:14:13.41)
Tadao Hiiragi : But Kagami also did it this morning. 	(0:14:14.87)
Konata Izumi : See. 	(0:14:17.81)
Kagami Hiiragi : I was seen. 	(0:14:19.70)
Konata Izumi : Looks like Comp Festival's pretty popular. 	(0:14:21.62)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What's that? 	(0:14:24.22)
Konata Izumi : If you collect the forms that come in these magazines and send them in... 	(0:14:25.59)
Konata Izumi : ...you can get every single limited edition QUO card. 	(0:14:30.10)
Konata Izumi : I'm constantly taking magazines to the register like I'm possessed. 	(0:14:34.89)
Kagami Hiiragi : You were saying the same thing about QUO cards the other day. 	(0:14:39.60)
Kagami Hiiragi : Japanese people are really weak when it comes to special gifts or limited edition stuff. 	(0:14:43.03)
Konata Izumi : That's why it's essential to buy one for preservation, one to look at, and one extra. 	(0:14:47.22)
Kagami Hiiragi : Wait! 	(0:14:52.08)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're undeniably a special case! 	(0:14:52.83)
Kagami Hiiragi : There aren't many people like you. 	(0:14:55.23)
Konata Izumi : Sometimes, I forget who I lent it to and have to buy another one. 	(0:14:57.04)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't forget. 	(0:15:00.79)
Konata Izumi : So... 	(0:15:01.96)
Konata Izumi : I'd like to ask you about that usual thing. 	(0:15:02.69)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Homework! 	(0:15:05.88)
Kagami Hiiragi : Again? 	(0:15:06.72)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'll teach you the stuff you don't know... 	(0:15:07.89)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...so try doing the problems yourself. 	(0:15:10.35)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Balsamic vinegar. 	(0:15:14.55)
Konata Izumi : Kagami. 	(0:15:16.97)
Konata Izumi : Tell me how to do this one. 	(0:15:18.31)
Kagami Hiiragi : For this one... 	(0:15:20.85)
Konata Izumi : Kagami. 	(0:15:26.23)
Konata Izumi : I don't know how to do here through here. 	(0:15:27.32)
Kagami Hiiragi : That was close. 	(0:15:33.11)
Konata Izumi : Kagami. 	(0:15:34.97)
Konata Izumi : This one is... 	(0:15:36.06)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're not even trying to think it through, are you?! 	(0:15:36.27)
Konata Izumi : I am thinking it through. 	(0:15:42.58)
Kagami Hiiragi : Really... 	(0:15:44.34)
Konata Izumi : And I don't know any of the ones past this one. 	(0:15:45.63)
Kagami Hiiragi : You aren't thinking after all! 	(0:15:48.63)
Konata Izumi : She ended up not telling me how to do them. 	(0:15:52.09)
Yui Narumi : Hey! 	(0:15:54.97)
Yui Narumi : I'm here to play! 	(0:15:56.02)
Konata Izumi : Yui-nee san. 	(0:15:57.84)
Konata Izumi : Perfect timing. 	(0:15:58.64)
Konata Izumi : Teach me this part. 	(0:16:00.43)
Yui Narumi : Math homework? 	(0:16:02.93)
Yui Narumi : Let's see. 	(0:16:04.86)
Yui Narumi : Leave it to me. 	(0:16:05.57)
Yui Narumi : Well... 	(0:16:08.06)
Yui Narumi : I must say, as a good police officer... 	(0:16:09.07)
Yui Narumi : ...my help would not be to your benefit... 	(0:16:12.53)
Yui Narumi : ...so don't depend on others! 	(0:16:14.12)
Konata Izumi : It's such a pain when I don't understand any of the questions... 	(0:16:24.20)
Yui Narumi : If you don't know the answer... 	(0:16:28.17)
Yui Narumi : ...just write something that sounds close. 	(0:16:29.13)
Yui Narumi : Because you just have to turn the homework in. 	(0:16:32.71)
Konata Izumi : I get it. 	(0:16:35.76)
Konata Izumi : You're smart! 	(0:16:36.72)
Konata Izumi : But this really weakens what she said before... 	(0:16:38.09)
Konata Izumi : I doubt this will be to my benefit... 	(0:16:42.56)
Yui Narumi : Yeah... 	(0:16:45.23)
Yui Narumi : That's what I did! 	(0:16:45.86)
Konata Izumi : I'm exhausted... 	(0:16:48.19)
Konata Izumi : I'll do a little gaming for a break. 	(0:16:51.57)
Konata Izumi : I'll do some solo hunting for thirty minutes. 	(0:16:57.32)
Konata Izumi : Thirty minutes should be okay. 	(0:17:00.46)
Konata Izumi : Solo hunting, right? Right? 	(0:17:06.25)
Konata Izumi : ...becomes fiction. 	(0:17:14.59)
Konata Izumi : ...what make you strong. 	(0:17:19.30)
Konata Izumi : This isn't... 	(0:17:22.10)
Konata Izumi : ...else. 	(0:17:24.97)
Konata Izumi : A rare drop. 	(0:17:32.81)
Konata Izumi : Laevateinn! 	(0:17:35.23)
Konata Izumi : I've never seen anyone with this! 	(0:17:36.66)
Konata Izumi : It's ultra rare! 	(0:17:38.83)
Konata Izumi : Found a Laeva sword! 	(0:17:42.41)
Konata Izumi : Okay. Come on! 	(0:17:58.86)
Konata Izumi : Well, where should we try it out? 	(0:18:01.84)
Konata Izumi : Everybody's pumped up. 	(0:18:05.39)
Konata Izumi : That's right. 	(0:18:07.19)
Konata Izumi : I'll buy a bunch of quality potions to pass out. 	(0:18:07.69)
Konata Izumi : Let's go back to town first... 	(0:18:11.85)
Konata Izumi : Gonna get busy! 	(0:18:14.86)
Akira Kogami : Morning luckies! 	(0:18:23.78)
Akira Kogami : I'm your navigator, Kogami Akira! 	(0:18:25.66)
Akira Kogami : We're already on the fifth episode of Lucky Channel! 	(0:18:28.13)
Akira Kogami : Let's get even crazier! 	(0:18:31.51)
Akira Kogami : Now let me introduce... 	(0:18:35.17)
Akira Kogami : ...someone who's showing up more often in the actual show and getting full of it... 	(0:18:37.22)
Akira Kogami : I mean... 	(0:18:41.14)
Akira Kogami : The hardworking... 	(0:18:42.93)
Akira Kogami : Shiraishi Minoru-san! 	(0:18:44.64)
Akira Kogami : Clap. Clap. Clap. 	(0:18:46.81)
Minoru Shiraishi : Well... 	(0:18:47.93)
Minoru Shiraishi : I didn't mean to look like I was full of it... 	(0:18:48.61)
Minoru Shiraishi : I'm the assistant, Shiraishi Minoru. 	(0:18:51.31)
Minoru Shiraishi : It's a pleasure! 	(0:18:53.99)
Akira Kogami : Okay. 	(0:18:55.69)
Akira Kogami : We're always receiving lots of postcards. 	(0:18:56.53)
Akira Kogami : Today's is from U.S.S. Gatoh-san in Tokyo. 	(0:18:59.87)
Minoru Shiraishi : Occupation: NEET. 	(0:19:03.95)
Minoru Shiraishi : This guy sent in fifty by himself... 	(0:19:05.79)
Akira Kogami : He must be one sorry guy! 	(0:19:08.17)
Akira Kogami : Let's move on to the postcard. 	(0:19:11.09)
Akira Kogami : Good day, Akira-san and Minoru-san. 	(0:19:13.25)
Akira Kogami : In the actual show, Konata-chan seems to play MMOs. 	(0:19:16.01)
Akira Kogami : Do you also play these games, Akira-san? 	(0:19:19.76)
Akira Kogami : By the way, I live a happy life playing female characters every day. 	(0:19:23.84)
Minoru Shiraishi : MMOs? 	(0:19:31.56)
Minoru Shiraishi : Online games? 	(0:19:32.94)
Minoru Shiraishi : I'm sorry to say that I've never tried it. 	(0:19:34.61)
Akira Kogami : But it's better if you haven't. 	(0:19:38.11)
Minoru Shiraishi : Another blunt response... 	(0:19:39.95)
Minoru Shiraishi : R-Really? 	(0:19:43.28)
Akira Kogami : Too many people getting addicted and giving up on the real world. 	(0:19:45.37)
Akira Kogami : I was dumb like that once. 	(0:19:50.00)
Akira Kogami : I would log on whenever I had time... 	(0:19:52.38)
Akira Kogami : ...and stay on forever doing stuff like PKKing. 	(0:19:54.13)
Akira Kogami : Back when I was young. 	(0:19:58.29)
Minoru Shiraishi : Wh-When you were young...? 	(0:20:00.09)
Minoru Shiraishi : Er... 	(0:20:01.93)
Minoru Shiraishi : There were a bunch of words I didn't get... 	(0:20:02.89)
Akira Kogami : You're better off not knowing. 	(0:20:06.72)
Akira Kogami : Well, only half the audience is going to get it anyway. 	(0:20:08.89)
Minoru Shiraishi : A-Anyway, so you've played them before? 	(0:20:13.44)
Minoru Shiraishi : Then do you have any online experiences you would like to share? 	(0:20:16.24)
Akira Kogami : Yep! 	(0:20:20.61)
Akira Kogami : Memories! I have some! 	(0:20:21.28)
Akira Kogami : When l first started... 	(0:20:24.03)
Akira Kogami : ...I didn't know what to do... 	(0:20:25.45)
Akira Kogami : ...and I got lots of help from some really nice and experienced guys! 	(0:20:26.79)
Akira Kogami : They gave me lots of expensive armor and rare items! 	(0:20:31.13)
Akira Kogami : Akira was so touched! 	(0:20:35.55)
Minoru Shiraishi : R-Really... 	(0:20:38.08)
Akira Kogami : It was really fun, so you should all play, too! 	(0:20:40.18)
Akira Kogami : We're already out of time. 	(0:20:44.71)
Akira Kogami : Bye-nee! 	(0:20:46.81)
Minoru Shiraishi : Then we'll see you next time. 	(0:20:48.73)
Minoru Shiraishi : So you're popular in those kind of games, huh? 	(0:20:51.72)
Minoru Shiraishi : Huh? 	(0:20:55.77)
Minoru Shiraishi : Akira-sama? 	(0:20:57.44)
Minoru Shiraishi : What's wrong? 	(0:20:58.90)
Akira Kogami : Cut 12 on page 38. 	(0:20:59.86)
Minoru Shiraishi : Yes? 	(0:21:02.53)
Akira Kogami : Who the hell is Yutaka?! 	(0:21:03.73)
Minoru Shiraishi : That's what you're mad about this time?! 	(0:21:05.91)
Akira Kogami : I'm Akira! 	(0:21:06.70)
Minoru Shiraishi : Well, that's true... 	(0:21:08.41)
Akira Kogami : Bring out whoever's responsible! 	(0:21:08.83)
Minoru Shiraishi : No! Uh... 	(0:21:10.43)
Minoru Shiraishi : D-Director? 	(0:21:11.06)
Minoru Shiraishi : Director?! 	(0:21:11.66)
Minoru Shiraishi : Ah, no. 	(0:21:12.46)
Akira Kogami : The hell is Yutaka?! 	(0:21:13.03)
Minoru Shiraishi : A producer would be better. 	(0:21:13.13)
Minoru Shiraishi : Producer would be better! 	(0:21:13.77)
Minoru Shiraishi : Hey! 	(0:21:14.69)
Minoru Shiraishi : A-Akira-san! 	(0:21:15.04)
Minoru Shiraishi : Please calm down! 	(0:21:15.92)
Minoru Shiraishi : Please! 	(0:21:17.29)
Akira Kogami : You know. 	(0:21:17.51)
Minoru Shiraishi : Yes? 	(0:21:18.82)
Akira Kogami : Why don't we change Shiraishi Minoru's name... 	(0:21:19.17)
Akira Kogami : ...to something else? 	(0:21:21.59)
Akira Kogami : Like Su- 	(0:21:23.26)
Konata Izumi : Kagamin, you're so cool! 	(0:21:26.86)
Kagami Hiiragi : Cut that out. 	(0:21:28.64)
Kagami Hiiragi : So is Tsukasa or Miyuki next? 	(0:21:30.10)
Konata Izumi : Me. 	(0:21:32.69)
Kagami Hiiragi : Again?! 	(0:21:33.40)
Kagami Hiiragi : When did you order a song?! 	(0:21:34.36)
Konata Izumi : They were taking too long, and it'd be a waste of time. 	(0:21:35.77)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Sorry. 	(0:21:39.11)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I need a little more time to decide. 	(0:21:39.99)
Miyuki Takara : I'm sorry. 	(0:21:41.90)
Kagami Hiiragi : It's okay. 	(0:21:43.27)
Kagami Hiiragi : We can kill some time with Konata's singing. 	(0:21:44.62)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I know this! 	(0:21:50.99)
Kagami Hiiragi : Didn't expect you to go with something mainstream. 	(0:21:52.04)
Konata Izumi : Kami rules! 	(0:21:55.29)
Konata Izumi : Sparking! 	(0:21:56.67)
EXTRA : Well, next time on Lucky Star: 	(0:22:57.43)
Konata Izumi : Konata here. 	(0:22:59.27)
Konata Izumi : When you first start Monster Hunter Dos... 	(0:23:00.89)
Konata Izumi : ...the condition for learning weapons is defeating five Gearnos. 	(0:23:03.49)
Konata Izumi : So once you return to town... 	(0:23:07.87)
Konata Izumi : ...and get sent on a quest by the elder... 	(0:23:09.07)
Konata Izumi : ...even if you defeat five Gearnos... 	(0:23:11.52)
Konata Izumi : ...get loads of snow mountain grass... 	(0:23:13.93)
Konata Izumi : ...and lots of poponotan... 	(0:23:16.08)
Konata Izumi : ...when you can't go back to town... 	(0:23:17.88)
Konata Izumi : ...you realize for the first time that you can't access your supply box yourself... 	(0:23:19.79)
Konata Izumi : ...and your reward is decreased since you didn't read the instruction manual... 	(0:23:23.59)
Konata Izumi : ...and you can't save up money. 	(0:23:27.84)
Konata Izumi : Doesn't it make you wonder about how this applies to the real world? 	(0:23:29.72)
Konata Izumi : Next time: 	(0:23:34.01)
Konata Izumi : Summer Events! 	(0:23:35.02)
Konata Izumi : Look forward to next time! 	(0:23:36.89)
Konata Izumi : Summer! 	(0:01:35.14)
Konata Izumi : The sea! 	(0:01:35.77)
Konata Izumi : So sensei and nee san are in charge of supervising and driving today. 	(0:01:36.97)
Yui Narumi : Gotcha! 	(0:01:42.15)
Nanako Kuroi : Gotcha! 	(0:01:42.15)
Konata Izumi : But you know... 	(0:01:43.28)
Konata Izumi : The two of you have a lot of free time. 	(0:01:45.02)
Kagami Hiiragi : Sorry to impose on your day off. 	(0:01:52.53)
Yui Narumi : It's nothing. 	(0:01:55.21)
Yui Narumi : Don't sweat it. 	(0:01:55.79)
Kagami Hiiragi : Narumi-san... 	(0:01:57.42)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're an officer in the traffic safety department, right? 	(0:01:58.54)
Yui Narumi : That's right. 	(0:02:01.38)
Yui Narumi : I know all there is to know about traffic law. 	(0:02:02.72)
Yui Narumi : He passed me. 	(0:02:06.21)
Yui Narumi : Bastard... 	(0:02:07.71)
Kagami Hiiragi : Wa- 	(0:02:08.72)
Kagami Hiiragi : Hey! 	(0:02:09.05)
Kagami Hiiragi : What happened to safety first? 	(0:02:09.72)
Konata Izumi : Nee san goes wild once her hand's on the wheel. 	(0:02:10.94)
Konata Izumi : Guess we'll have to sacrifice Kagami and Tsukasa. 	(0:02:14.34)
Nanako Kuroi : Really... 	(0:02:17.76)
Nanako Kuroi : Isn't she a cop? 	(0:02:18.98)
Nanako Kuroi : Huh? 	(0:02:21.12)
Nanako Kuroi : That's odd. 	(0:02:21.86)
Nanako Kuroi : I lost sight of them. 	(0:02:22.64)
Konata Izumi : Sensei, that's the wrong way! 	(0:02:26.02)
Konata Izumi : That's a one-way street! 	(0:02:27.90)
Konata Izumi : I messed up big time! 	(0:02:30.79)
Konata Izumi : I didn't expect them both to fail! 	(0:02:32.16)
EXTRA : That car's incredible! 	(0:02:55.72)
EXTRA : Who is it?! 	(0:02:57.14)
EXTRA : They both have perfect braking and drifting! 	(0:02:58.18)
EXTRA : It's practically on top of the FDI! 	(0:03:00.36)
EXTRA : And it's got better acceleration! 	(0:03:02.27)
EXTRA : It's practically touching the guard rail! 	(0:03:04.52)
Yui Narumi : The point of attack will come... 	(0:03:07.02)
Yui Narumi : ...in the five consecutive hairpin curves ahead! 	(0:03:09.82)
EXTRA : It's speeding up! 	(0:03:17.12)
EXTRA : Did the brakes die?! 	(0:03:18.92)
EXTRA : Incredible! 	(0:03:25.08)
Kagami Hiiragi : What's with the (bleep) D-like driving?! 	(0:03:28.38)
Konata Izumi : Nanako-san... 	(0:03:33.67)
Konata Izumi : You're really good... 	(0:03:35.85)
Konata Izumi : ...at driving... 	(0:03:37.43)
Nanako Kuroi : Yeah? 	(0:03:39.80)
Konata Izumi : You see... 	(0:03:41.27)
Konata Izumi : I get sick whenever I'm in a car. 	(0:03:42.31)
Konata Izumi : That's why I brought medicine... 	(0:03:45.64)
Konata Izumi : But I didn't feel sick at all with you at the wheel. 	(0:03:49.49)
Nanako Kuroi : Like! 	(0:03:56.61)
Nanako Kuroi : I don't have time to be talking to you! 	(0:03:57.41)
Nanako Kuroi : Well... 	(0:04:15.84)
Nanako Kuroi : How about we find a hotel? 	(0:04:17.18)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : The clear sky is perfect weather for a day at the beach. 	(0:04:27.44)
Kagami Hiiragi : Seriously... 	(0:04:30.45)
Kagami Hiiragi : I was getting worried there yesterday. 	(0:04:31.20)
Konata Izumi : I'll put on my swimsuit before we go! 	(0:04:33.51)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're such a child...! 	(0:04:36.38)
Kagami Hiiragi : Konata-san! 	(0:04:39.41)
Kagami Hiiragi : Are you seriously wearing that? 	(0:04:40.16)
Kagami Hiiragi : And like... 	(0:04:41.76)
Kagami Hiiragi : I've never heard of someone wearing a school swimsuit at this age. 	(0:04:42.75)
Konata Izumi : Some people have special needs, Kagamin. 	(0:04:45.96)
Kagami Hiiragi : H-H-How old is that swimsuit?! 	(0:04:49.26)
Kagami Hiiragi : Besides... 	(0:04:53.96)
Kagami Hiiragi : Why are you wearing a swim ring when you're good at sports stuff? 	(0:04:55.22)
Konata Izumi : The ocean doesn't exist solely for wasting effort on swimming. 	(0:04:58.64)
Konata Izumi : You should take it leisurely. 	(0:05:02.73)
Konata Izumi : Leisure time. 	(0:05:04.61)
Konata Izumi : Plus, to meet those special needs... 	(0:05:06.27)
Konata Izumi : ...you have to wear a school swimsuit with a swim ring. 	(0:05:08.32)
Kagami Hiiragi : People with special needs... 	(0:05:11.65)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...won't be coming to the beach. 	(0:05:13.11)
Konata Izumi : Watermelon cracking is the usual event in manga and anime... 	(0:05:18.95)
Konata Izumi : ...but it doesn't happen much in reality. 	(0:05:22.33)
Kagami Hiiragi : I've seen it before... 	(0:05:24.25)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...but people probably feel like it's a waste. 	(0:05:26.59)
Konata Izumi : That's true... 	(0:05:28.54)
Konata Izumi : If you blow up a watermelon with a gun... 	(0:05:29.88)
Konata Izumi : ...you'll end up covered in watermelon. 	(0:05:32.26)
Kagami Hiiragi : You watch too much anime. 	(0:05:34.39)
Konata Izumi : Have you ever played it before, Miyuki-san? 	(0:05:35.92)
Konata Izumi : Since you're rich. 	(0:05:37.72)
Miyuki Takara : I haven't. 	(0:05:39.06)
Konata Izumi : Well, on second thought... 	(0:05:40.98)
Konata Izumi : It doesn't seem like something rich people would do. 	(0:05:42.77)
Kagami Hiiragi : You have a point. 	(0:05:45.90)
Konata Izumi : It was obvious... 	(0:05:55.32)
Konata Izumi : ...but I guess your eyes don't end up like in manga. 	(0:05:56.57)
Miyuki Takara : I'm sorry to disappoint you. 	(0:05:59.08)
Nanako Kuroi : But y'know, yeah? 	(0:06:01.70)
Nanako Kuroi : A girls only babysitting trip to the beach at this age... 	(0:06:03.75)
Nanako Kuroi : We're some lonely, single girls, huh? 	(0:06:07.25)
Yui Narumi : You're mistak- 	(0:06:09.84)
Nanako Kuroi : But yeah... 	(0:06:10.29)
Nanako Kuroi : If the alternative is resorting to bringing something like that... 	(0:06:11.42)
Nanako Kuroi : ...I'm all for a girls only trip. 	(0:06:14.59)
Yui Narumi : No, I'm... 	(0:06:16.72)
Nanako Kuroi : They're telling people to marry late these days. 	(0:06:17.17)
Nanako Kuroi : Might as well take our time and choose well. 	(0:06:19.97)
Yui Narumi : You're mistaken. 	(0:06:22.94)
Yui Narumi : My husband just happens to be busy working far away. 	(0:06:24.31)
Yui Narumi : I'm already married! 	(0:06:26.90)
Konata Izumi : The beach is a mecca for flirting... 	(0:06:29.27)
Konata Izumi : ...but it doesn't apply to us, huh? 	(0:06:31.17)
Kagami Hiiragi : Well, it's less annoying this way. 	(0:06:33.40)
Kagami Hiiragi : Besides, this thing... 	(0:06:36.32)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...probably makes people think we're sisters here on a family trip. 	(0:06:37.28)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : There we go. 	(0:06:45.24)
Konata Izumi : What's up? 	(0:06:54.56)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Well... 	(0:06:56.29)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It kind of feels icky to sit down when I'm still wet. 	(0:06:57.34)
Miyuki Takara : I understand how you feel. 	(0:07:01.05)
Konata Izumi : Then you can use an air chair. 	(0:07:02.22)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're pretty extreme. 	(0:07:04.64)
Kagami Hiiragi : What is it? 	(0:07:11.73)
Konata Izumi : My neck's tired. 	(0:07:12.65)
Kagami Hiiragi : Really now. 	(0:07:13.78)
Konata Izumi : Just as expected! 	(0:07:16.44)
Kagami Hiiragi : What are you so happy about? 	(0:07:17.69)
Konata Izumi : Because I got something straight out of a storybook beach house. 	(0:07:19.62)
Konata Izumi : Look at how the curry is sauce and nothing else. 	(0:07:22.91)
Konata Izumi : This is true beach house fare! 	(0:07:24.95)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That's true. 	(0:07:26.37)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Usually, you wouldn't be willing to eat something like this... 	(0:07:27.54)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...but here, it actually tastes good! 	(0:07:30.29)
Nanako Kuroi : The beer they got at the beach is the best! 	(0:07:38.34)
Nanako Kuroi : Generic beer isn't too bad once in a while. 	(0:07:41.05)
Yui Narumi : I find it odd that they're charging 300 yen for a single frankfurter. 	(0:07:43.68)
Konata Izumi : Yeah! 	(0:07:48.06)
Konata Izumi : Maybe they're only half-cooked. 	(0:07:49.10)
Konata Izumi : But we'll eat it anyway. 	(0:07:50.65)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I actually like how their chicken is... 	(0:07:52.10)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...dripping in grease and over-spiced. 	(0:07:54.69)
Miyuki Takara : And this plain fried soba... 	(0:07:58.36)
Miyuki Takara : ...is quite nice. 	(0:08:00.36)
Nanako Kuroi : But still... 	(0:08:01.74)
Nanako Kuroi : You couldn't stand eating this stuff at home! 	(0:08:03.12)
Konata Izumi : Konata's touched. 	(0:08:07.99)
Kagami Hiiragi : Hey. 	(0:08:12.41)
Kagami Hiiragi : Does this food really warrant so much praise? 	(0:08:13.83)
Konata Izumi : Not really. 	(0:08:15.96)
Konata Izumi : Not enough to make you run towards the ocean in a loincloth. 	(0:08:16.92)
Kagami Hiiragi : Is that another anime reference? 	(0:08:19.88)
Nanako Kuroi : Drank too much... 	(0:08:30.47)
Nanako Kuroi : No choice. 	(0:08:31.74)
Nanako Kuroi : Let's stay another night. 	(0:08:32.77)
Konata Izumi : Yui-nee san, what about work? 	(0:08:34.02)
Yui Narumi : I also took tomorrow off. 	(0:08:35.90)
Yui Narumi : It's fine! 	(0:08:37.65)
Nanako Kuroi : I-It's freezing... 	(0:08:44.69)
Konata Izumi : Sensei, you're exaggerating. 	(0:08:46.99)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Why is your hair all squeaky... 	(0:09:20.33)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...after you've been in the ocean? 	(0:09:22.80)
Kagami Hiiragi : Dunno. 	(0:09:24.91)
Kagami Hiiragi : Maybe it has to do with salt or something. 	(0:09:25.66)
Kagami Hiiragi : Right, Miyuki? 	(0:09:28.37)
Miyuki Takara : That's right. 	(0:09:30.24)
Miyuki Takara : The main reason would be salt content and UV rays. 	(0:09:31.50)
Konata Izumi : What's so bad about it? 	(0:09:34.79)
Konata Izumi : Isn't your hair always getting hit by UV rays? 	(0:09:37.00)
Miyuki Takara : Well... 	(0:09:40.05)
Miyuki Takara : It'll take a little while... 	(0:09:41.18)
Miyuki Takara : ...to explain that in detail. 	(0:09:43.22)
Miyuki Takara : In that case... 	(0:09:46.55)
Miyuki Takara : The reason your hair is damaged by a trip to the beach... 	(0:09:50.51)
Miyuki Takara : ...would be the adhesion of salt from seawater and the sea breeze... 	(0:09:52.73)
Miyuki Takara : ...which absorbs the moisture from your hair... 	(0:09:56.02)
Miyuki Takara : ...which now suffers from exposure to strong UV rays. 	(0:09:58.23)
Miyuki Takara : Also... 	(0:10:01.24)
Miyuki Takara : Whenever you are exposed to strong UV rays outdoors... 	(0:10:02.15)
Miyuki Takara : ...your melanin levels will fade... 	(0:10:04.36)
Miyuki Takara : ...and your hair will become light brown. 	(0:10:06.24)
Miyuki Takara : And if residual quantities of salt or chlorine remain in your hair... 	(0:10:08.78)
Miyuki Takara : ...they may result in the discoloration of your hair. 	(0:10:12.37)
Miyuki Takara : The usual reason for hair damage in summer... 	(0:10:16.48)
Miyuki Takara : ...would be UV rays and residual substances. 	(0:10:18.94)
Miyuki Takara : The above factors cause damage to the cuticles. 	(0:10:21.69)
Miyuki Takara : When exposed to strong UV rays... 	(0:10:26.09)
Miyuki Takara : ...the cysteine molecules found in strong hair are broken up... 	(0:10:27.80)
Konata Izumi : Look! Look! 	(0:10:33.72)
Konata Izumi : Timotei! 	(0:10:35.35)
Konata Izumi : Timotei! 	(0:10:36.85)
Konata Izumi : Timotei! 	(0:10:38.35)
Kagami Hiiragi : What's that? 	(0:10:39.78)
Nanako Kuroi : I wonder how other people would see us. 	(0:10:47.44)
Yui Narumi : Not sure... 	(0:10:51.61)
Yui Narumi : Nothing to talk about... 	(0:10:56.63)
Nanako Kuroi : Nothing to talk about... 	(0:10:56.63)
Yui Narumi : Probably family or relatives? 	(0:11:00.04)
Nanako Kuroi : Guess you're right. 	(0:11:04.22)
Yui Narumi : That's all you have to say? 	(0:11:07.06)
Konata Izumi : Nee san! Nee san! 	(0:11:08.59)
Konata Izumi : Timotei! 	(0:11:10.14)
Konata Izumi : Timotei! 	(0:11:11.59)
Konata Izumi : Timotei! 	(0:11:13.13)
Yui Narumi : I remember that! 	(0:11:15.18)
Yui Narumi : I used to do it! 	(0:11:16.02)
Konata Izumi : Yes! 	(0:11:16.89)
Konata Izumi : That's the response I wanted! 	(0:11:17.65)
Nanako Kuroi : How old are you? 	(0:11:19.90)
Konata Izumi : Mandom! 	(0:11:24.56)
Kagami Hiiragi : Cut out the geezer jokes. 	(0:11:25.44)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What's wrong, Kona-chan? 	(0:11:27.36)
Konata Izumi : I just triggered a flag. 	(0:11:28.99)
Kagami Hiiragi : What are you talking about? 	(0:11:30.82)
Konata Izumi : This is where the event starts! 	(0:11:32.14)
Konata Izumi : In order to see both paths... 	(0:11:34.12)
Konata Izumi : ...don't forget to save often before a split! 	(0:11:36.71)
Konata Izumi : No exceptions! 	(0:11:38.42)
Konata Izumi : Picture complete. 	(0:11:42.51)
Konata Izumi : Perfect! 	(0:11:47.13)
Konata Izumi : Bring it on! 	(0:11:48.05)
Kagami Hiiragi : No idea what's going on. 	(0:11:48.63)
Kagami Hiiragi : Anyway... 	(0:11:50.63)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...you being like this is why... 	(0:11:51.72)
Konata Izumi : Why...? 	(0:11:53.97)
Kagami Hiiragi : Why nobody came to hit on us. 	(0:11:55.06)
Kagami Hiiragi : Y-You're the one who brought it up in the first place! 	(0:11:58.89)
Kagami Hiiragi : I could really care less about that stuff. 	(0:12:02.36)
Konata Izumi : So Kagami wanted someone to hit on her. 	(0:12:06.73)
Kagami Hiiragi : N-No... 	(0:12:10.20)
Miyuki Takara : No! 	(0:12:11.37)
Konata Izumi : Damn it! 	(0:12:13.78)
Konata Izumi : I missed it! 	(0:12:14.62)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What is it? 	(0:12:21.03)
Kagami Hiiragi : I was wondering what you do about hair. 	(0:12:23.70)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Mine's pretty smooth, so I don't do anything. 	(0:12:27.19)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What about you, Sis? 	(0:12:31.92)
Kagami Hiiragi : M-Me?! 	(0:12:32.97)
Kagami Hiiragi : I guess I'm normal. 	(0:12:34.31)
Kagami Hiiragi : Actually, today was kinda dangerous. 	(0:12:45.73)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What? 	(0:12:49.48)
Kagami Hiiragi : Well... 	(0:12:50.45)
Kagami Hiiragi : You know... 	(0:12:52.11)
Kagami Hiiragi : Almost happened... 	(0:12:53.45)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Oh, that? 	(0:12:55.74)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I see. 	(0:12:56.83)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Good thing then. 	(0:12:57.24)
Kagami Hiiragi : You were okay? 	(0:12:58.68)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : No problem at all. 	(0:13:00.70)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Mine ended a week ago. 	(0:13:02.26)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : The timing was perfect. 	(0:13:03.69)
Kagami Hiiragi : It really sucks when that happens. 	(0:13:06.37)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You're right. 	(0:13:09.04)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It would be sad if you were the only one who couldn't go in the water... 	(0:13:10.25)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : But using that would be a little... 	(0:13:13.01)
Kagami Hiiragi : Yeah. 	(0:13:15.30)
Kagami Hiiragi : Makes you think twice. 	(0:13:16.22)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I've never used one. 	(0:13:17.47)
Konata Izumi : That was a candid conversation. 	(0:13:21.01)
Kagami Hiiragi : Wh-What about you? 	(0:13:23.27)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't tell me... 	(0:13:26.31)
Konata Izumi : What's with that look? 	(0:13:27.65)
Kagami Hiiragi : Nothing. 	(0:13:29.03)
Konata Izumi : Apparently, this is a true story... 	(0:13:30.60)
Konata Izumi : A photo software wholesaler... 	(0:13:35.19)
Konata Izumi : ...was on his way home from work... 	(0:13:38.12)
Konata Izumi : ...and got on the bus as usual late at night... 	(0:13:40.29)
Konata Izumi : His house was... 	(0:13:44.41)
Konata Izumi : ...at the end of the bus line. 	(0:13:46.04)
Konata Izumi : So... 	(0:13:49.05)
Konata Izumi : As more and more passengers got off... 	(0:13:49.76)
Konata Izumi : ...eventually, he was the only person left on the bus... 	(0:13:53.43)
Konata Izumi : The driver thought that nobody was left on the bus... 	(0:13:59.59)
Konata Izumi : ...and... 	(0:14:05.60)
Konata Izumi : ...sang "DANZEN! Futari wa ***Cure" at the top of his lungs! 	(0:14:08.52)
Konata Izumi : Just a rumor I heard. 	(0:14:15.00)
Nanako Kuroi : It was nothing... 	(0:14:17.41)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What a relief... 	(0:14:44.68)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I was so scared. 	(0:14:45.77)
Yui Narumi : I'm also... 	(0:14:48.56)
Konata Izumi : I'm Sukekiyo. 	(0:14:49.61)
Yui Narumi : Where'd you get that mask from?! 	(0:14:54.35)
Yui Narumi : Then good night. 	(0:14:56.44)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Yes. 	(0:14:57.87)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Good night. 	(0:14:58.28)
Konata Izumi : The Inugami Family! 	(0:14:59.58)
Konata Izumi : It's so much fun to scare you. 	(0:15:02.86)
Kagami Hiiragi : How about you go to sleep already? 	(0:15:04.91)
Nanako Kuroi : Hey! 	(0:15:12.50)
Nanako Kuroi : We're going! 	(0:15:13.26)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Okay! 	(0:15:14.79)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I don't have anything interesting to say. 	(0:15:50.04)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I'm Tsukasa. 	(0:15:56.58)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I'm Tsukasa. 	(0:15:58.39)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Onee-chan! 	(0:16:10.60)
Kagami Hiiragi : What is it? 	(0:16:13.32)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I was scared! 	(0:16:14.32)
Konata Izumi : A girl just took a step towards becoming an adult, Kagamin. 	(0:16:14.68)
Konata Izumi : Comp Festival is a big hit. 	(0:16:22.44)
Kagami Hiiragi : 'Cause Japanese people are suckers for limited edition stuff. 	(0:16:25.24)
Konata Izumi : If the words "limited edition" are enough to boost sales... 	(0:16:28.37)
Konata Izumi : ...they could just add it to everything. 	(0:16:31.04)
Kagami Hiiragi : That would cheapen the value. 	(0:16:33.33)
EXTRA : So I went and asked. 	(0:16:35.76)
EXTRA : Yes. 	(0:16:38.34)
Tadao Hiiragi : Clean your room before break's over. 	(0:16:38.92)
Kagami Hiiragi : Whoa, how nostalgic! 	(0:16:46.13)
Kagami Hiiragi : These textbooks are from middle school. 	(0:16:47.73)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Onee-chan. 	(0:16:49.39)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Look at this album! 	(0:16:50.44)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Isn't this picture of otou-san a little risqué? 	(0:16:52.76)
Kagami Hiiragi : Right? 	(0:16:54.57)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That's when I started wondering about otou-san's thing. 	(0:16:55.23)
Tadao Hiiragi : You look like you're having fun... 	(0:16:58.60)
Tadao Hiiragi : ...but are you getting any cleaning done? 	(0:16:59.65)
Kagami Hiiragi : Um... 	(0:17:02.40)
Inori Hiiragi : Hey. 	(0:17:04.83)
Inori Hiiragi : Do you want these clothes? 	(0:17:05.41)
Kagami Hiiragi : If you don't need them, I'll take them. 	(0:17:07.65)
Inori Hiiragi : Then I'll leave them here. 	(0:17:09.16)
Kagami Hiiragi : Thanks. 	(0:17:11.03)
Inori Hiiragi : Hey. 	(0:17:14.24)
Inori Hiiragi : Do you want this? 	(0:17:14.92)
Kagami Hiiragi : Then I guess I'll take it. 	(0:17:16.29)
Inori Hiiragi : What about this? 	(0:17:17.64)
Inori Hiiragi : This? 	(0:17:19.25)
Kagami Hiiragi : Wait! 	(0:17:20.17)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't tell me she's using me as her trash can... 	(0:17:20.84)
Kagami Hiiragi : You end up looking through photo albums and stuff instead. 	(0:17:24.09)
Konata Izumi : I know what you mean. 	(0:17:27.38)
Konata Izumi : If any old magazines are lying around, I start reading them. 	(0:17:28.52)
Kagami Hiiragi : That's right. 	(0:17:31.23)
Konata Izumi : Oh, yeah. What about Tsukasa? 	(0:17:32.94)
Kagami Hiiragi : She doesn't throw anything away, so it takes a while. 	(0:17:34.40)
Kagami Hiiragi : She's still at it. 	(0:17:38.23)
Konata Izumi : Tsukasa's always slow to act. 	(0:17:39.94)
Konata Izumi : On the other hand, Kagami's always trigger happy. 	(0:17:42.57)
Kagami Hiiragi : Why is your impression of me... 	(0:17:45.41)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...so aggressive? 	(0:17:48.04)
Konata Izumi : You saved your textbooks from middle school. 	(0:17:50.78)
Kagami Hiiragi : You don't have anything like that? 	(0:17:53.66)
Konata Izumi : I left them with my memories at my old school. 	(0:17:55.58)
Kagami Hiiragi : No, take them home. 	(0:17:59.54)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're causing trouble for the school. 	(0:18:01.01)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I finally finished cleaning. 	(0:18:03.46)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I don't think that I'll ever use this again... 	(0:18:06.17)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...but then I remember how I just used it... 	(0:18:08.35)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...so I can't throw it away. 	(0:18:10.52)
Konata Izumi : Yeah. 	(0:18:12.23)
Konata Izumi : There really are people who keep everything. 	(0:18:12.81)
Konata Izumi : Tsukasa seems the type. 	(0:18:15.56)
Kagami Hiiragi : You seem like someone who even throws away useful stuff. 	(0:18:17.72)
Kagami Hiiragi : Seeing as how you ditched your textbooks. 	(0:18:20.86)
Yukari Takara : Miyuki. 	(0:18:23.98)
Yukari Takara : Go have your teeth taken care of... 	(0:18:25.07)
Yukari Takara : ...before school starts up again. 	(0:18:26.66)
Miyuki Takara : I understand... 	(0:18:28.82)
Miyuki Takara : ...but I just don't like it. 	(0:18:30.91)
Yukari Takara : Well, I would feel bad about forcing you to go. 	(0:18:33.84)
Yukari Takara : If you can't go... 	(0:18:38.41)
Yukari Takara : ...I'll have him come. 	(0:18:39.46)
Yukari Takara : A visit from the dentist. 	(0:18:40.55)
Miyuki Takara : P-Please wait! 	(0:18:41.55)
Akira Kogami : Morning luckies! 	(0:18:48.76)
Akira Kogami : We've already burst into the sixth episode of Lucky Channel! 	(0:18:50.44)
Akira Kogami : I hope that you've all become familiar with this corner. 	(0:18:54.44)
Akira Kogami : I'm Kogami Akira! 	(0:18:58.40)
Minoru Shiraishi : Lame! 	(0:19:00.78)
Akira Kogami : You say something? 	(0:19:02.10)
Akira Kogami : It appears that newbie Shiraishi-kun isn't used to the job and is a nervous wreck. 	(0:19:05.11)
Minoru Shiraishi : I'm scared... 	(0:19:07.50)
Minoru Shiraishi : So scared... 	(0:19:08.30)
Akira Kogami : You're all making his heart race. 	(0:19:08.91)
Minoru Shiraishi : Whad did I do wrong? 	(0:19:09.22)
Minoru Shiraishi : We went to the mountains 'cause Akira-sama said so. 	(0:19:11.21)
Akira Kogami : I hope he gets used to the job soon. 	(0:19:11.79)
Minoru Shiraishi : Yeah. 	(0:19:13.35)
Minoru Shiraishi : Went to the beach, too. 	(0:19:13.93)
Akira Kogami : And he better watch how he talks to his senpais around here. 	(0:19:14.16)
Minoru Shiraishi : I'm doing everything I can to make this show funnier! 	(0:19:15.02)
Akira Kogami : How many times do I have to tell him before he undertands. 	(0:19:17.50)
Minoru Shiraishi : Yeah... 	(0:19:18.94)
Minoru Shiraishi : The gum was hard... 	(0:19:19.69)
Akira Kogami : It's getting irritating. 	(0:19:20.13)
Minoru Shiraishi : But it was fifty-four pieces. 	(0:19:21.15)
Akira Kogami : Today we'll introduce a key Lucky Star character... 	(0:19:22.08)
Minoru Shiraishi : Fifty-four pieces in my mouth! 	(0:19:22.40)
Minoru Shiraishi : But I still worked hard! 	(0:19:24.40)
Akira Kogami : Izumi Konata-san! 	(0:19:24.84)
Minoru Shiraishi : What else will I have to do? 	(0:19:26.20)
Akira Kogami : Hey. 	(0:19:29.46)
Akira Kogami : Stop blubbering. 	(0:19:29.80)
Minoru Shiraishi : Why me?! 	(0:19:30.19)
Akira Kogami : Let's see... 	(0:19:32.84)
Akira Kogami : Izumi Konata-san. 	(0:19:33.77)
Akira Kogami : Seventeen years old. 	(0:19:34.73)
Akira Kogami : Her hobbies are gaming, watching anime, and reading. 	(0:19:35.56)
Minoru Shiraishi : Uh... 	(0:19:37.89)
Minoru Shiraishi : According to the data... 	(0:19:38.69)
Minoru Shiraishi : ...she always checks out new shows and books. 	(0:19:39.86)
Minoru Shiraishi : And spends weekends storming through net games until dawn. 	(0:19:42.40)
Akira Kogami : In other words, an otaku? 	(0:19:45.28)
Minoru Shiraishi : Uh... 	(0:19:47.11)
Minoru Shiraishi : Looks like it... 	(0:19:47.91)
Minoru Shiraishi : Come up with something quick! 	(0:19:50.23)
Minoru Shiraishi : By otaku, you mean that, right? 	(0:19:51.65)
Minoru Shiraishi : The ones in their house all the time, right? 	(0:19:53.20)
Minoru Shiraishi : The ones who cry when watching A Dog of Flanders, right? 	(0:19:54.50)
Akira Kogami : How dated is your image of an otaku in your head? 	(0:19:58.07)
Akira Kogami : Are you doing your homework?! 	(0:20:00.83)
Akira Kogami : Don't go saying random stuff! 	(0:20:02.55)
Minoru Shiraishi : N-No, uh... 	(0:20:04.42)
Akira Kogami : Well it's true that both A Dog of Flanders and kawaii moe characters have a healing effect. 	(0:20:06.12)
Akira Kogami : But rather than a dog, a girl like me is much better! 	(0:20:12.10)
Akira Kogami : They're seeking kawaii and cute maidens! 	(0:20:15.10)
Akira Kogami : Understand? 	(0:20:17.73)
Akira Kogami : If I look right, they look right! 	(0:20:18.86)
Akira Kogami : If I look left, they look left! 	(0:20:21.02)
Akira Kogami : When they line up for my concert the night before, they can't take a shower! 	(0:20:22.70)
Akira Kogami : That may cause hygienic problems. 	(0:20:25.99)
Akira Kogami : But they still want to see me! 	(0:20:27.95)
Akira Kogami : That determination drives them into the blistering heat, burning in the sun in wait of my arrival! 	(0:20:29.37)
Akira Kogami : Until the bandanna around their head get so wet that you can wring sweat out! 	(0:20:34.58)
Akira Kogami : You know... 	(0:20:42.20)
Akira Kogami : They're still customers. 	(0:20:43.29)
Akira Kogami : Even if when I'm doing handshakes afterward they won't stop talking. 	(0:20:45.67)
Akira Kogami : Or if they make some off-topic comment during my MC. 	(0:20:49.59)
Akira Kogami : You kinda get sympathetic, you know? 	(0:20:52.51)
Akira Kogami : I'm only here because of them. 	(0:20:55.72)
Akira Kogami : I have to work hard for them. 	(0:20:58.73)
Akira Kogami : You know? 	(0:21:02.10)
Minoru Shiraishi : Is that how it is... 	(0:21:03.11)
Akira Kogami : You'll know soon enough. 	(0:21:05.36)
Akira Kogami : How hard it is to be an idol... 	(0:21:07.46)
Akira Kogami : Once you've been through the good and bad, you'll see how it really is. 	(0:21:09.82)
Akira Kogami : Can't do anything about fans or clients you hate... 	(0:21:13.62)
Akira Kogami : Perfect timing! 	(0:21:17.03)
Akira Kogami : Hey, everybody! 	(0:21:18.45)
Akira Kogami : Do you know who Konata-san is now? 	(0:21:19.33)
Akira Kogami : Then we'll see you on next week's Lucky Channel! 	(0:21:21.75)
Akira Kogami : Bye-nee! 	(0:21:24.88)
Minoru Shiraishi : Or rather... 	(0:21:27.33)
Minoru Shiraishi : You didn't even introduce Konata... 	(0:21:28.01)
Minoru Shiraishi : More like you introduced otakus. 	(0:21:29.55)
Minoru Shiraishi : A-Akira-sama? 	(0:21:32.13)
Minoru Shiraishi : You okay? 	(0:21:32.89)
Akira Kogami : Do it. 	(0:21:34.01)
Minoru Shiraishi : Understood! 	(0:21:35.51)
Minoru Shiraishi : What the correspondent saw then was... 	(0:21:36.56)
Akira Kogami : Not funny. 	(0:21:38.31)
Konata Izumi : Kage sure is awesome. 	(0:21:43.91)
Kagami Hiiragi : We get the idea. 	(0:21:46.13)
Kagami Hiiragi : So did you order a song, Tsukasa? 	(0:21:47.98)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I did. 	(0:21:49.98)
Miyuki Takara : Tsukasa-san singing will be quite refreshing. 	(0:21:50.95)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I wonder if I can sing it well. 	(0:21:54.52)
Kagami Hiiragi : Miyuki, what are you going to sing? 	(0:21:56.94)
Miyuki Takara : I really don't know many songs... 	(0:21:58.62)
Miyuki Takara : It's quite embarrassing. 	(0:22:01.29)
Kagami Hiiragi : So she went with this, huh? 	(0:22:05.54)
Miyuki Takara : Tsukasa-san, go for it! 	(0:22:07.34)
Kagami Hiiragi : Hey, now. 	(0:22:20.68)
Kagami Hiiragi : Who's that? 	(0:22:24.47)
Kagami Hiiragi : So who is she already?! 	(0:22:35.44)
Kagami Hiiragi : Shut up already! 	(0:22:47.79)
EXTRA : Well, next time on Lucky Star: 	(0:23:10.98)
Kagami Hiiragi : Kagami here. 	(0:23:13.73)
Kagami Hiiragi : When you try to get rid of a hanging nail... 	(0:23:14.99)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...and give it a little tug... 	(0:23:17.16)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...but then you end up pulling off too much... 	(0:23:18.16)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...it really hurts, doesn't it? 	(0:23:19.70)
Kagami Hiiragi : Also... 	(0:23:22.16)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...there's the timing for ripping off a scab. 	(0:23:23.00)
Kagami Hiiragi : When it starts to itch... 	(0:23:24.71)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...and you're thinking that it's about time... 	(0:23:25.62)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...so you pick it off bit by bit. 	(0:23:26.87)
Kagami Hiiragi : And just when you're like everything is good... 	(0:23:28.84)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...it still ends up bleeding! 	(0:23:31.55)
Kagami Hiiragi : It leaves some serious damage. 	(0:23:33.09)
Kagami Hiiragi : Next time: 	(0:23:35.25)
Kagami Hiiragi : Image. 	(0:23:36.05)
EXTRA : Look forward to it! 	(0:23:37.13)
Konata Izumi : Well, let's get going. 	(0:00:00.91)
Miyuki Takara : Let's go! 	(0:00:02.38)
Kagami Hiiragi : Stop messing around and start! 	(0:00:04.00)
Kagami Hiiragi : I haven't put on my uniform in a while. 	(0:01:33.15)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It's Kona-chan. 	(0:01:37.49)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Kona-chan! 	(0:01:38.79)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Good morning! 	(0:01:39.62)
Konata Izumi : My... 	(0:01:42.41)
Konata Izumi : Kagami-san. 	(0:01:43.50)
Konata Izumi : Tsukasa-san. 	(0:01:44.52)
Konata Izumi : A very good day to you. 	(0:01:46.00)
Konata Izumi : Why, Tsukasa-san... 	(0:01:49.79)
Konata Izumi : Your ribbon is crooked. 	(0:01:52.51)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Thanks. 	(0:01:55.05)
Kagami Hiiragi : Gross. 	(0:01:56.01)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What brought this on, Kona-chan? 	(0:01:57.01)
Konata Izumi : Yes. 	(0:01:59.35)
Konata Izumi : I have become hooked on Marimite. 	(0:02:00.22)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Marimite? 	(0:02:03.94)
Kagami Hiiragi : Are you a kid?! 	(0:02:04.90)
Kagami Hiiragi : Hey... 	(0:02:10.27)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't start copying their costumes, too. 	(0:02:11.40)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Um... 	(0:02:14.53)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Is that called cosplay? 	(0:02:15.24)
Konata Izumi : I wouldn't go that far. 	(0:02:16.62)
Kagami Hiiragi : You mean it, right? 	(0:02:18.74)
Konata Izumi : I already do plenty of that at work. 	(0:02:19.99)
Kagami Hiiragi : Oh, yeah... 	(0:02:23.66)
Kagami Hiiragi : You work at one of those places... 	(0:02:24.33)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : But if Kona-chan was an ojou-sama... 	(0:02:26.74)
Kagami Hiiragi : Feels so wrong that I can't even picture it. 	(0:02:34.75)
Konata Izumi : Baseball games have been going over schedule too much recently. 	(0:02:37.38)
Konata Izumi : Why are the new anime forced to sacrifice? 	(0:02:40.51)
Kagami Hiiragi : If you want to watch anime that badly... 	(0:02:44.09)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...you could get cable or something. 	(0:02:45.94)
Kagami Hiiragi : Aren't there specialized channels for that stuff? 	(0:02:48.11)
Konata Izumi : If I could... 	(0:02:50.77)
Konata Izumi : I want to get it too... 	(0:02:51.98)
Konata Izumi : But the cable guys said all sorts of stuff... 	(0:02:53.53)
Konata Izumi : ...like, "We can't proved it there". 	(0:02:55.86)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Yuki-chan. 	(0:03:00.32)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Good morning. 	(0:03:01.20)
Miyuki Takara : Good morning, Tsukasa-san. 	(0:03:02.45)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You look kinda down, did something happen? 	(0:03:05.78)
Miyuki Takara : Actually, I went to have my cavity taken care of. 	(0:03:08.29)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You went to the dentist. 	(0:03:12.41)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Impressive! 	(0:03:14.22)
Miyuki Takara : Why are there so many follow-up trips after a visit to the dentist? 	(0:03:15.29)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I totally know what you mean! 	(0:03:21.34)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : And it isn't just one or two trips! 	(0:03:23.87)
Konata Izumi : Miyuki-san. 	(0:03:26.60)
Konata Izumi : Good day. 	(0:03:27.83)
Miyuki Takara : Konata-san. 	(0:03:29.81)
Miyuki Takara : Good day. 	(0:03:30.94)
Konata Izumi : Have you been well? 	(0:03:32.09)
Miyuki Takara : Thank you for asking. 	(0:03:34.48)
Miyuki Takara : I'm pleased to see you looking well. 	(0:03:35.65)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Yuki-chan's so amazing. 	(0:03:36.65)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : She's talking the same way... 	(0:03:38.24)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...but it doesn't feel weird at all. 	(0:03:39.62)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : And she isn't even questioning the way Kona-chan's talking. 	(0:03:41.66)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : This is the first time I've seen a person say "good day" in real life! 	(0:03:45.41)
Miyuki Takara : Really? 	(0:03:50.29)
Miyuki Takara : It appears to be a regularly used greeting... 	(0:03:51.54)
Miyuki Takara : ...at the girls' school my friends go to. 	(0:03:54.09)
Konata Izumi : A real school for rich girls is something else. 	(0:03:58.63)
Konata Izumi : How refined. 	(0:04:01.64)
Minoru Shiraishi : Kuroi... 	(0:04:02.97)
Minoru Shiraishi : ...told me to collect summer homework for her. 	(0:04:03.97)
Konata Izumi : Excellent work, Sebastian. 	(0:04:06.64)
Minoru Shiraishi : S-Seba— 	(0:04:08.64)
Konata Izumi : Butlers must be named Sebastian, do you not agree? 	(0:04:09.55)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You do get that impression. 	(0:04:13.35)
Konata Izumi : Tell us a funny story, Sebastian. 	(0:04:15.03)
Minoru Shiraishi : Ain't happening! 	(0:04:16.23)
Nanako Kuroi : Okay. 	(0:04:17.27)
Nanako Kuroi : Vacation just ended... 	(0:04:18.07)
Nanako Kuroi : ...but you got no time to be mooching around. 	(0:04:19.70)
Nanako Kuroi : Start thinking about your future... 	(0:04:21.69)
Nanako Kuroi : ...and put effort into studying. 	(0:04:23.78)
Kagami Hiiragi : By future, does she mean choosing a major? 	(0:04:26.24)
Kagami Hiiragi : I guess high school is only a temporary stopping point. 	(0:04:29.16)
Konata Izumi : But you probably haven't done much thinking about the future, right? 	(0:04:31.71)
Kagami Hiiragi : Why? 	(0:04:36.29)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't insult me! 	(0:04:36.67)
Konata Izumi : 'Cause... 	(0:04:37.72)
Konata Izumi : You chose liberal arts to be in the same class with everyone else, right? 	(0:04:38.38)
Kagami Hiiragi : Tsu-Tsukasa! 	(0:04:42.39)
Kagami Hiiragi : You blabbed! 	(0:04:43.51)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Ah, sorries. 	(0:04:44.28)
Kagami Hiiragi : And you told her... 	(0:04:45.60)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...o-of all people! 	(0:04:47.06)
Konata Izumi : Come on... 	(0:04:48.18)
Konata Izumi : You should have just been honest. 	(0:04:48.98)
Konata Izumi : You hate being lonely, don't you? 	(0:04:51.06)
Konata Izumi : There, there. 	(0:04:53.44)
Kagami Hiiragi : Shut up! 	(0:04:54.93)
Yui Narumi : Hey! 	(0:05:03.86)
Yui Narumi : I'm back! 	(0:05:05.03)
Konata Izumi : Nee-san... 	(0:05:07.28)
Konata Izumi : For my summer homework... 	(0:05:08.74)
Konata Izumi : I did as you told me and wrote down random stuff when I didn't know the answer... 	(0:05:10.46)
Konata Izumi : ...and now I have to redo it all! 	(0:05:16.30)
Konata Izumi : Help me! 	(0:05:18.26)
Yui Narumi : O-Okay... 	(0:05:20.17)
Yui Narumi : But... 	(0:05:21.93)
Yui Narumi : If you get help from me, you might have to redo it again... 	(0:05:23.18)
Yui Narumi : ...in all sorts of ways. 	(0:05:26.31)
Konata Izumi : She got out of it... 	(0:05:27.10)
Konata Izumi : An extension on homework without an extension on summer vacation... 	(0:05:28.30)
Konata Izumi : Maybe I should borrow Kagami's notes. 	(0:05:32.52)
Konata Izumi : The sound of cicadas puts me to sleep. 	(0:05:54.33)
Konata Izumi : Huh? 	(0:06:01.63)
Konata Izumi : I see... 	(0:06:10.01)
Konata Izumi : The schedule's off because the baseball game went over. 	(0:06:11.31)
Konata Izumi : I guess it can be useful sometimes. 	(0:06:15.31)
Konata Izumi : My recorder's off! 	(0:06:18.73)
Konata Izumi : Huh? 	(0:06:20.98)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Where are your glasses, Yuki-chan? 	(0:06:21.74)
Miyuki Takara : Actually... 	(0:06:23.45)
Miyuki Takara : They broke this morning... 	(0:06:24.36)
Miyuki Takara : I forgot that I left them on the chair... 	(0:06:26.61)
Miyuki Takara : ...and accidentally... 	(0:06:29.62)
Miyuki Takara : I'm terribly sorry... 	(0:06:30.99)
Miyuki Takara : ...but could I borrow your notes for today later? 	(0:06:32.08)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Sure. 	(0:06:35.28)
Konata Izumi : You still got the clumsy thing going. 	(0:06:36.17)
Miyuki Takara : Konata-san... 	(0:06:40.12)
Miyuki Takara : Your handwriting is a mystery to me. 	(0:06:41.30)
Miyuki Takara : Tsukasa-san... 	(0:06:44.88)
Miyuki Takara : Hang in there! 	(0:06:46.34)
Kagami Hiiragi : They sure are useless. 	(0:06:47.96)
Kagami Hiiragi : Here. 	(0:06:50.85)
Miyuki Takara : Thank you so much. 	(0:06:51.64)
Kagami Hiiragi : Good thing we have the same teacher. 	(0:06:53.27)
Miyuki Takara : Um... 	(0:06:56.44)
Miyuki Takara : But please keep this a secret... 	(0:06:57.23)
Miyuki Takara : I don't wish to ruin their good intentions... 	(0:07:00.07)
Konata Izumi : I'm starving! 	(0:07:04.94)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Yuki-chan! 	(0:07:06.82)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Let's have lunch! 	(0:07:07.87)
Miyuki Takara : Tsukasa-san. 	(0:07:09.99)
Miyuki Takara : Konata-san. 	(0:07:10.95)
Miyuki Takara : Thank you for letting me use your notes. 	(0:07:12.15)
Konata Izumi : Nah. 	(0:07:14.08)
Konata Izumi : No need to thank us. 	(0:07:15.46)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I never expected Yuki-chan to borrow my notes. 	(0:07:17.46)
Kagami Hiiragi : Well... 	(0:07:21.38)
Kagami Hiiragi : It's not happening again. 	(0:07:21.88)
EXTRA : STARE 	(0:07:25.45)
Miyuki Takara : U-Um... 	(0:07:27.59)
Miyuki Takara : Is there something on my face? 	(0:07:28.93)
Konata Izumi : In games, when a character who wears glasses shows up at school without them... 	(0:07:31.34)
Konata Izumi : ...they suddenly become popular... 	(0:07:34.48)
Konata Izumi : But I guess that doesn't happen in real life. 	(0:07:36.60)
Miyuki Takara : I-It really doesn't. 	(0:07:38.69)
Miyuki Takara : Unfortunately. 	(0:07:40.56)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't chocolate cornets kinda look like drills? 	(0:07:42.14)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : D-Drills... 	(0:07:44.90)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : D-Didn't we discuss which side of a chocolate cornet was the head? 	(0:07:47.36)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Like how the thin end looked like the bottom. 	(0:07:51.99)
Konata Izumi : On second thought... 	(0:07:55.24)
Konata Izumi : ...the fat end looks more like the bottom. 	(0:07:56.50)
Kagami Hiiragi : Bottom? 	(0:07:58.62)
Kagami Hiiragi : That's one big bottom... 	(0:08:01.83)
Kagami Hiiragi : And layers of stomach. 	(0:08:03.21)
Miyuki Takara : When the lower half of your body gains weight... 	(0:08:04.71)
Miyuki Takara : ...it becomes difficult to buy skirts and the like. 	(0:08:06.67)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That's right! 	(0:08:09.59)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : If you use your waist measurements, you can't get it over your hips. 	(0:08:10.72)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : If it fits your hips perfectly, it's loose around your waist. 	(0:08:13.35)
Miyuki Takara : You have no choice but to buy one that's too big for your waist... 	(0:08:15.98)
Miyuki Takara : ...and when you walk around in it, your skirt starts spinning, doesn't it? 	(0:08:19.23)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That's right! 	(0:08:22.82)
Konata Izumi : A body with layers of stomach looks like a cornet... 	(0:08:23.77)
Konata Izumi : If you turn it on the side... 	(0:08:26.19)
Konata Izumi : ...you can play it like a cornet. 	(0:08:27.49)
Konata Izumi : If you turn it again, you can... 	(0:08:28.80)
Konata Izumi : ...put it on your head like a cornet. 	(0:08:30.95)
Kagami Hiiragi : I don't get where I'm supposed to laugh. 	(0:08:32.10)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Onee-chan, weren't you dieting to make up for your added summer weight? 	(0:08:34.40)
Kagami Hiiragi : But my weight went down... 	(0:08:39.78)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...without my waist or hips changing. 	(0:08:41.54)
Konata Izumi : No, Kagami. 	(0:08:43.92)
Konata Izumi : I can see the fruits of your diet. 	(0:08:45.30)
Kagami Hiiragi : Really? 	(0:08:48.42)
Konata Izumi : It's plain to see. 	(0:08:49.63)
Konata Izumi : They say that when you diet, you lose weight in the places you don't want to first. 	(0:08:52.30)
Kagami Hiiragi : Okay already! 	(0:08:57.64)
Kagami Hiiragi : You don't have to spell it out. 	(0:08:58.73)
EXTRA : When reading literature... 	(0:09:02.20)
EXTRA : ...the trick is to keep the theme in mind... 	(0:09:04.23)
EXTRA : ...and understand what the author is trying to convey. 	(0:09:06.92)
Konata Izumi : I get it... 	(0:09:07.39)
Konata Izumi : I heard that people with poor eyesight end up with nasty expressions that scare other people... 	(0:09:09.98)
Konata Izumi : ...but I guess... 	(0:09:14.37)
Konata Izumi : ...it depends on the person. 	(0:09:15.87)
Kagami Hiiragi : Hey, you! 	(0:09:17.33)
Kagami Hiiragi : When you said it depends on the person... 	(0:09:18.64)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...you glanced over at me, didn't you?! 	(0:09:20.16)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I've heard that thinner eyes make you look prettier. 	(0:09:21.83)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It makes you look more mature. 	(0:09:25.71)
Kagami Hiiragi : Hey. 	(0:09:31.13)
Kagami Hiiragi : Stop that! 	(0:09:31.80)
Kagami Hiiragi : She's late! 	(0:09:34.88)
Kagami Hiiragi : Stupid Konata... 	(0:09:36.31)
Kagami Hiiragi : What's she doing? 	(0:09:37.39)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : She's here! 	(0:09:39.30)
Konata Izumi : Sorry! 	(0:09:40.39)
Konata Izumi : I'm late. 	(0:09:41.67)
Kagami Hiiragi : Way late! 	(0:09:42.56)
Kagami Hiiragi : Someone who's always complaining about night games lasting too long... 	(0:09:43.60)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...shouldn't be so loose with time! 	(0:09:46.44)
Konata Izumi : Well, you know... 	(0:09:48.15)
Konata Izumi : All the games have been going over schedule lately, so... 	(0:09:49.24)
Konata Izumi : I guess it infected me. 	(0:09:52.69)
Kagami Hiiragi : Like it's contagious! 	(0:09:54.28)
Kagami Hiiragi : So? 	(0:09:55.19)
Kagami Hiiragi : Why were you late? 	(0:09:55.70)
Kagami Hiiragi : Overslept? 	(0:09:57.03)
Konata Izumi : No way. 	(0:09:57.79)
Konata Izumi : I'm not a child. 	(0:09:58.58)
Kagami Hiiragi : Then give me an adult reason for why you were late. 	(0:10:00.33)
Konata Izumi : Well... 	(0:10:03.33)
Konata Izumi : There was still plenty of time left when I finished getting ready... 	(0:10:04.38)
Konata Izumi : So to kill time... 	(0:10:09.92)
Konata Izumi : ...I started playing games and couldn't stop... 	(0:10:11.30)
Kagami Hiiragi : You suck. 	(0:10:13.34)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're worse than a child. 	(0:10:14.39)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Oh, yeah. 	(0:10:15.80)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : There are a bunch of cultural festivals and sporting events during second semester, right? 	(0:10:17.13)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : And we have tests soon. 	(0:10:21.52)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Kona-chan is really athletic so she can do well in sporting events. 	(0:10:23.47)
Konata Izumi : I don't like sporting events 'cause they make me tired. 	(0:10:27.93)
Kagami Hiiragi : Pretty rare to see such a lazy athletic type. 	(0:10:30.03)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I wonder what our class will do for the cultural festival. 	(0:10:34.36)
Konata Izumi : There isn't anything I'd want to do. 	(0:10:37.37)
Kagami Hiiragi : These things... 	(0:10:40.16)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...can never be decided... 	(0:10:41.25)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...unless someone wants to do something. 	(0:10:43.46)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : And the person who brings up the idea usually gets put in charge... 	(0:10:44.75)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...so nobody's willing to talk. 	(0:10:47.38)
Kagami Hiiragi : And you have to stay after school to prepare. 	(0:10:49.42)
Konata Izumi : You won't be able to watch evening anime. 	(0:10:52.54)
Kagami Hiiragi : Knew you'd say that. 	(0:10:54.93)
Konata Izumi : It's my turn to cook dinner tonight. 	(0:11:02.22)
Konata Izumi : Have to stop by the store on the way home. 	(0:11:04.98)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What are you going to make? 	(0:11:07.76)
Konata Izumi : Everyone's favorite chicken curry! 	(0:11:09.19)
Konata Izumi : Everyone in our family loves chicken. 	(0:11:11.90)
Kagami Hiiragi : Curry, huh? 	(0:11:14.98)
Kagami Hiiragi : Sounds good. 	(0:11:16.14)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I've heard that letting curry sit overnight makes it taste better. 	(0:11:17.07)
Konata Izumi : It works well. 	(0:11:21.24)
Konata Izumi : Then I'll make some extra and bring it for lunch tomorrow. 	(0:11:22.82)
Konata Izumi : Since there'll be leftovers anyway. 	(0:11:27.04)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Yes. 	(0:11:30.79)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : This is the Hiiragi residence. 	(0:11:31.42)
Konata Izumi : Tsukasa? 	(0:11:32.96)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Kona-chan! 	(0:11:34.58)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Why are you calling so early? 	(0:11:35.51)
Konata Izumi : The curry... 	(0:11:37.84)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Curry? 	(0:11:39.30)
Konata Izumi : The curry I made yesterday... 	(0:11:40.30)
Konata Izumi : I let it sit overnight, and now it's spoiled. 	(0:11:42.26)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : No way. 	(0:11:45.05)
Konata Izumi : Really. 	(0:11:45.98)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Why? 	(0:11:46.92)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Curry usually doesn't go bad in one day. 	(0:11:47.92)
Konata Izumi : Right? 	(0:11:50.40)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Did you put in anything weird? 	(0:11:51.48)
Konata Izumi : I didn't. 	(0:11:53.15)
Konata Izumi : But... 	(0:11:53.86)
Konata Izumi : ...there was mold in it this morning! 	(0:11:54.90)
Kagami Hiiragi : So? 	(0:11:56.32)
Kagami Hiiragi : Another cornet today? 	(0:11:57.11)
Konata Izumi : They taste good, so it's okay. 	(0:11:58.32)
Kagami Hiiragi : If you say so... 	(0:12:00.16)
Konata Izumi : Oh, yeah... 	(0:12:02.57)
Konata Izumi : I just noticed... 	(0:12:03.99)
Konata Izumi : ...but the difference between when your bento are... 	(0:12:05.66)
Konata Izumi : ...made properly... 	(0:12:07.95)
Konata Izumi : ...or made very simply... 	(0:12:10.29)
Konata Izumi : ...is really obvious. 	(0:12:12.16)
Kagami Hiiragi : Ts-Tsukasa and I take turns making lunch... 	(0:12:14.17)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'm not good with housework... 	(0:12:18.96)
Kagami Hiiragi : So, it always ends up being simple! 	(0:12:21.18)
Kagami Hiiragi : Well, sorry that's the case! 	(0:12:23.86)
Konata Izumi : What?! 	(0:12:25.88)
Konata Izumi : So you're the type of person... 	(0:12:26.48)
Konata Izumi : ...who can blow up pots when they cook?! 	(0:12:27.98)
Kagami Hiiragi : Nobody in the world can do that. 	(0:12:30.23)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Yuki-chan's bento looks wonderful again today. 	(0:12:33.02)
Miyuki Takara : Not at all. 	(0:12:35.73)
Miyuki Takara : Today's lunch is just leftovers from last night. 	(0:12:36.81)
Konata Izumi : Dinner at Miyuki-san's place... 	(0:12:41.57)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Is really fancy... 	(0:12:43.62)
Kagami Hiiragi : And these are just the leftovers. 	(0:12:45.24)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Um... 	(0:12:47.41)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What's inside these fried eggs? 	(0:12:48.37)
Miyuki Takara : We had some eel leftover last night, so I added it in. 	(0:12:52.49)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You don't usually see leftovers for eel. 	(0:12:57.46)
Konata Izumi : The only thing that's ever leftover at our house is moldy curry. 	(0:12:59.72)
Kagami Hiiragi : Your house isn't normal. 	(0:13:02.68)
Konata Izumi : Good morning. 	(0:13:06.09)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Good morning! 	(0:13:07.14)
Kagami Hiiragi : Yo! 	(0:13:08.00)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Look! Look! 	(0:13:09.26)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : My parents bought me a cell phone! 	(0:13:10.60)
Konata Izumi : Good for you. 	(0:13:13.06)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : 'Cause I did well on my practical exams for once. 	(0:13:14.48)
Konata Izumi : Give me your number. 	(0:13:18.03)
Konata Izumi : I'll give you mine. 	(0:13:19.57)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What is my number again? 	(0:13:22.15)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Um... 	(0:13:25.44)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Hold on a second! 	(0:13:38.25)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Um... Um... 	(0:13:54.26)
Kagami Hiiragi : Konata. 	(0:13:54.87)
Kagami Hiiragi : You have a cell phone? 	(0:13:55.71)
Konata Izumi : But I usually forget it at home. 	(0:13:57.85)
Konata Izumi : Since otou-san's the only one who ever calls. 	(0:14:00.23)
Kagami Hiiragi : Doesn't that defeat the purpose of having a cell phone? 	(0:14:02.91)
Konata Izumi : You think? 	(0:14:05.66)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Keroro! 	(0:14:06.57)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Isn't it cute? 	(0:14:07.61)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : They bought it for me with the cell phone. 	(0:14:09.32)
Kagami Hiiragi : Oh, yeah... 	(0:14:12.04)
Kagami Hiiragi : There was a girl in our class who had a bunch of straps on her phone. 	(0:14:13.21)
Kagami Hiiragi : They weighed it... 	(0:14:16.75)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...and the straps alone were 800 grams. 	(0:14:18.17)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That much? 	(0:14:21.67)
Konata Izumi : That's heavy. 	(0:14:22.80)
Kagami Hiiragi : Once she took the straps off... 	(0:14:24.01)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...her stiff shoulders were cured. 	(0:14:25.20)
Konata Izumi : Sounds like making a phone call would count as weight training. 	(0:14:27.14)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Isn't it exciting how you never know when you'll get a call on your cell phone? 	(0:14:32.05)
Kagami Hiiragi : Really? 	(0:14:36.52)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I hope someone calls me soon! 	(0:14:37.40)
Kagami Hiiragi : There's no need to get so excited over a cell phone nowadays. 	(0:14:39.94)
Konata Izumi : By the way, did you find your number yet? 	(0:14:44.73)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Not yet! 	(0:14:47.32)
Nanako Kuroi : In England... 	(0:14:48.86)
Nanako Kuroi : ...there was a large struggle between the House of Lancaster and the House of York. 	(0:14:49.83)
Nanako Kuroi : The two houses fought wearing red and white roses respectively. 	(0:14:53.91)
Nanako Kuroi : Thus, this war was known as the War of Roses. 	(0:14:58.54)
Nanako Kuroi : It lasted from 1455 to 1485. 	(0:15:01.05)
Nanako Kuroi : This... 	(0:15:05.47)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : M-Mine?! 	(0:15:07.46)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It's my phone! 	(0:15:09.55)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Somebody finally called me! 	(0:15:11.68)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Who's this? 	(0:15:20.14)
Nanako Kuroi : Okay. 	(0:15:21.02)
Nanako Kuroi : Confiscated. 	(0:15:21.94)
Nanako Kuroi : Pick it up in the faculty office after school. 	(0:15:24.65)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What a relief! 	(0:15:26.86)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : She gave it back! 	(0:15:28.28)
Konata Izumi : But junk mail already? 	(0:15:29.87)
Kagami Hiiragi : Otou-san? 	(0:15:36.28)
Kagami Hiiragi : Still at school. 	(0:15:38.24)
Kagami Hiiragi : I was talking with Konata and Miyuki and lost track of time. 	(0:15:39.54)
Kagami Hiiragi : It's okay. 	(0:15:43.29)
Kagami Hiiragi : We'll be home soon. 	(0:15:44.30)
Kagami Hiiragi : Bye. 	(0:15:45.84)
Kagami Hiiragi : Just a little late and look what happens. 	(0:15:47.71)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Yes? 	(0:15:52.92)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Otou-san? 	(0:15:54.36)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I'm still at school. 	(0:15:56.80)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I'm with Kona-chan and everyone. 	(0:15:58.14)
Kagami Hiiragi : You'd think he'd get the idea after calling one of us. 	(0:16:01.10)
Konata Izumi : Fathers are always worried about their daughters. 	(0:16:03.65)
Kagami Hiiragi : We sure get a lot of junk mail these days. 	(0:16:11.61)
Konata Izumi : It's better to make your address hard to guess. 	(0:16:15.28)
Konata Izumi : That's how I did it. 	(0:16:18.87)
Kagami Hiiragi : Hard to guess? 	(0:16:20.37)
Kagami Hiiragi : In what way? 	(0:16:21.84)
Konata Izumi : My e-mail address is in roman letters. 	(0:16:23.15)
Konata Izumi : iluvgiriswithglasses. 	(0:16:25.30)
Konata Izumi : I wanted to go with maids or something... 	(0:16:27.50)
Konata Izumi : But maids and shrine maidens are popular and easily... 	(0:16:30.30)
Kagami Hiiragi : Hold it right there! 	(0:16:33.43)
Kagami Hiiragi : We get it already... 	(0:16:34.64)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...so don't talk so loudly around the general public. 	(0:16:35.35)
Kagami Hiiragi : Your conversation is a bigger problem than the junk mail! 	(0:16:38.35)
Konata Izumi : Good morning! 	(0:16:44.27)
Kagami Hiiragi : Yo! 	(0:16:45.65)
Konata Izumi : What's wrong, Tsukasa? 	(0:16:50.02)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : My cell phone... 	(0:16:52.28)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : My cell phone...! 	(0:16:53.96)
Kagami Hiiragi : She left it in her pocket... 	(0:16:55.47)
Konata Izumi : It's gone to a better place, huh... 	(0:16:59.24)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I wonder if they'll buy me another one... 	(0:17:03.50)
Konata Izumi : This boy was safe. 	(0:17:07.62)
Konata Izumi : Tenacious little guy. 	(0:17:10.11)
Konata Izumi : Then the e-mail last night... 	(0:17:13.55)
Konata Izumi : The one that said Kagami wanted her notes back... 	(0:17:15.72)
Konata Izumi : That was the last one you sent? 	(0:17:20.52)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Yep. 	(0:17:22.35)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Did you reply? 	(0:17:23.36)
Konata Izumi : Um... 	(0:17:25.66)
Kagami Hiiragi : You never respond immediately when you get an e-mail, do you?! 	(0:17:26.15)
Konata Izumi : I don't reply to people I can talk to whenever I want. 	(0:17:29.65)
Kagami Hiiragi : Reply to e-mails through e-mail. 	(0:17:33.20)
Konata Izumi : We see each other every day. 	(0:17:34.84)
Konata Izumi : What's the point? 	(0:17:36.04)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're going to lose your friends. 	(0:17:38.00)
Konata Izumi : Oh, well. 	(0:17:39.66)
Konata Izumi : Wasn't that big a deal anyway. 	(0:17:40.56)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't decide that on your own! 	(0:17:42.21)
Kagami Hiiragi : And she didn't return my notes. 	(0:17:46.79)
Kagami Hiiragi : Tsukasa! 	(0:17:56.59)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'm coming in! 	(0:17:57.52)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Onee-chan. 	(0:17:59.84)
Kagami Hiiragi : Wh-What is it? 	(0:18:02.30)
Kagami Hiiragi : What's wrong? 	(0:18:03.52)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : This manga I borrowed from Kona-chan moved me to tears. 	(0:18:04.64)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Good morning! 	(0:18:08.48)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Kona-chan, thanks for the manga! 	(0:18:09.49)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It was great! 	(0:18:11.24)
Konata Izumi : Wasn't it so stupid and hilarious? 	(0:18:12.53)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I-It moved me to tears! 	(0:18:15.53)
Kagami Hiiragi : I find it hard to believe you're talking about the same manga. 	(0:18:18.61)
Konata Izumi : Here. 	(0:18:21.37)
Konata Izumi : If you cry, you're with Tsukasa. 	(0:18:22.12)
Konata Izumi : If you laugh, you're with me. 	(0:18:23.81)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'm not gonna read it! 	(0:18:25.46)
Kagami Hiiragi : I don't want to be classified with either of you. 	(0:18:26.71)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : But I wanna see how onee-chan reacts. 	(0:18:28.92)
Konata Izumi : Is it wrong to want to know more about your friends? 	(0:18:31.80)
Kagami Hiiragi : In that case... 	(0:18:36.59)
Kagami Hiiragi : Did Attack No. 1 make you cry or laugh? 	(0:18:37.47)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Cry. 	(0:18:40.18)
Kagami Hiiragi : Then what's your favorite manga? 	(0:18:41.50)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Keroro Gunsou. 	(0:18:43.20)
Konata Izumi : Keroro Gunsou. 	(0:18:43.20)
Kagami Hiiragi : I can't tell if these two are similar or not... 	(0:18:46.39)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Kona-chan, why don't you join a manga club? 	(0:18:50.19)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Since you love manga. 	(0:18:53.11)
Konata Izumi : Well, I'd be willing to do it... 	(0:18:54.57)
Konata Izumi : And it'd be a good use of time... 	(0:18:57.45)
Konata Izumi : Draw. Draw. Draw. Draw. 	(0:18:59.79)
Kagami Hiiragi : D-Did you even try on this?! 	(0:19:01.41)
Kagami Hiiragi : Incidentally, Konata-san... 	(0:19:05.03)
Kagami Hiiragi : What is this a picture of? 	(0:19:06.69)
Konata Izumi : This is Tsukasa. 	(0:19:08.50)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : This was me! 	(0:19:10.25)
Konata Izumi : This is Miyuki-san. 	(0:19:11.67)
Kagami Hiiragi : Well, I could really stretch and say that you captured her spirit... 	(0:19:13.01)
Konata Izumi : This is Kagami. 	(0:19:15.59)
Kagami Hiiragi : So I can breathe fire. 	(0:19:17.59)
Konata Izumi : My... 	(0:19:19.63)
Konata Izumi : It fits Kagami-san's image so perfectly. 	(0:19:20.81)
Konata Izumi : What a frightening child. 	(0:19:24.14)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'm telling you, stop that! 	(0:19:25.10)
Kagami Hiiragi : There's a new volume of Full Metal out. 	(0:19:28.18)
Konata Izumi : Right, I guess there's a release date coming up. 	(0:19:30.85)
Konata Izumi : I'm heading to Gamers. 	(0:19:33.40)
Konata Izumi : Wanna come along? 	(0:19:34.90)
Kagami Hiiragi : Sorry. 	(0:19:36.23)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'll just stop by a local bookstore today. 	(0:19:37.11)
Kagami Hiiragi : I have some other stuff to take care of. 	(0:19:39.18)
Konata Izumi : You're supposed to come with me as a sign of our friendship! 	(0:19:40.24)
Kagami Hiiragi : What is it? 	(0:19:44.79)
Kagami Hiiragi : You sure are clingy today. 	(0:19:45.83)
Kagami Hiiragi : Besides, words like friendship don't fit you well. 	(0:19:47.42)
Konata Izumi : Well, you know... 	(0:19:50.50)
Konata Izumi : I wanted you to give me your purchase points as a sign of our friendship. 	(0:19:51.46)
Kagami Hiiragi : So that's your idea of friendship. 	(0:19:55.71)
Konata Izumi : You've waited so long for me! 	(0:19:56.44)
Kagami Hiiragi : Thats so cheap. 	(0:19:58.00)
Minoru Shiraishi : It's quiet... 	(0:20:07.18)
Minoru Shiraishi : Is she mad about how I mixed up the ribbons on my twintails with sunflowers? 	(0:20:08.81)
Minoru Shiraishi : Me? 	(0:20:15.19)
Minoru Shiraishi : Me?! 	(0:20:18.77)
Minoru Shiraishi : To Akira-sama? 	(0:20:19.82)
Minoru Shiraishi : You sure? 	(0:20:20.66)
Minoru Shiraishi : Understood. 	(0:20:22.53)
Minoru Shiraishi : Uh. 	(0:20:24.03)
Minoru Shiraishi : Uh... 	(0:20:27.24)
Minoru Shiraishi : It started already... 	(0:20:27.75)
Minoru Shiraishi : No choice! 	(0:20:30.87)
Minoru Shiraishi : Before they change the channel... 	(0:20:31.38)
Minoru Shiraishi : Mo— 	(0:20:32.70)
Minoru Shiraishi : Morning luckies. 	(0:20:33.75)
Minoru Shiraishi : Just kidding! 	(0:20:35.53)
Minoru Shiraishi : Just wanted to say it. 	(0:20:36.63)
Minoru Shiraishi : W-Well, we're on another episode of Lucky Channel! 	(0:20:38.05)
Minoru Shiraishi : I'm Shiraishi Minoru! 	(0:20:40.97)
Minoru Shiraishi : Akira-sama's in a bad mood so... 	(0:20:42.81)
Akira Kogami : You said your own name before Kogami Akira. 	(0:20:47.51)
Akira Kogami : Do you not understand what natural order is? 	(0:20:51.65)
Minoru Shiraishi : No, that's... 	(0:20:54.73)
Akira Kogami : Looks like you have been getting ridiculously popular all over the place. 	(0:20:57.31)
Akira Kogami : With those twintails of yours. 	(0:21:01.50)
Minoru Shiraishi : I-I wouldn't call it popular... 	(0:21:02.66)
Akira Kogami : Don't be getting full of yourself! 	(0:21:04.45)
Minoru Shiraishi : I'm terribly sorry! 	(0:21:06.41)
Akira Kogami : Besides... 	(0:21:07.78)
Akira Kogami : People were expecting Akira Fashion Project to show me in twintails, right? 	(0:21:08.91)
Akira Kogami : So what's this? 	(0:21:14.25)
Minoru Shiraishi : It's just as you say! 	(0:21:15.04)
Akira Kogami : I'll go with twin drills! 	(0:21:17.96)
Minoru Shiraishi : T-Twin drills?! 	(0:21:19.97)
Minoru Shiraishi : Don't underestimate the Getter's speed. 	(0:21:22.17)
Akira Kogami : No. 2, huh? 	(0:21:23.72)
Akira Kogami : The age of twintails is over! 	(0:21:24.60)
Akira Kogami : The new thing is twin drills! 	(0:21:27.06)
Akira Kogami : Isn't that what Konata said? 	(0:21:29.10)
Akira Kogami : Drills are like a man's romance. 	(0:21:30.94)
Minoru Shiraishi : Romance, is it? 	(0:21:33.31)
Akira Kogami : Well, everybody! 	(0:21:34.47)
Akira Kogami : You can catch the rest of this on the radio show and our home page! 	(0:21:35.77)
Minoru Shiraishi : L-Look forward to next time. 	(0:21:38.56)
Akira Kogami : Bye-nee! 	(0:21:41.07)
Akira Kogami : Say... 	(0:21:44.53)
Minoru Shiraishi : Yes? 	(0:21:45.20)
Akira Kogami : About those twintails... 	(0:21:45.70)
Minoru Shiraishi : Ah, the ones I had? 	(0:21:47.10)
Akira Kogami : The ones in the real life picture. 	(0:21:48.82)
Minoru Shiraishi : Yes? 	(0:21:50.00)
Akira Kogami : You had sunflowers on, right? 	(0:21:50.50)
Minoru Shiraishi : I did. 	(0:21:51.71)
Akira Kogami : That looked awfully familiar... 	(0:21:52.58)
Minoru Shiraishi : You can't mean... 	(0:21:54.50)
Akira Kogami : How many years ago was it? 	(0:21:55.34)
Minoru Shiraishi : H-Hold on a sec! 	(0:21:56.27)
Akira Kogami : In one of my... 	(0:21:56.57)
Minoru Shiraishi : Gero gero! Gero gero! 	(0:21:57.63)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I was so nervous. 	(0:22:02.36)
Miyuki Takara : It was cute and wonderful. 	(0:22:03.99)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Isn't it so nerve-wracking when you're singing your first song? 	(0:22:06.24)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You wonder if your voice can be heard and stuff. 	(0:22:10.06)
Kagami Hiiragi : Miyuki's next, right? 	(0:22:11.85)
Konata Izumi : Sing us something full of memories. 	(0:22:13.35)
Kagami Hiiragi : Why? 	(0:22:16.15)
Miyuki Takara : May I have the mic? 	(0:22:17.73)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Here. 	(0:22:19.44)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Go for it! 	(0:22:20.11)
Miyuki Takara : Um, I'm not used to this kind of thing. 	(0:22:21.90)
Miyuki Takara : Please forgive me if it offends your ears. 	(0:22:24.91)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't worry. 	(0:22:27.54)
Kagami Hiiragi : Go for it! 	(0:22:28.62)
Kagami Hiiragi : Manly. 	(0:22:33.49)
Konata Izumi : I get it. 	(0:22:34.98)
Konata Izumi : This ties in to the other Miyuki. 	(0:22:36.09)
Kagami Hiiragi : Even her singing is manly. 	(0:22:47.63)
Konata Izumi : Is this a new kind of moe? 	(0:22:49.47)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Yuki-chan, you're so cool! 	(0:22:52.35)
EXTRA : Well, next time on Lucky Star: 	(0:23:31.42)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Tsukasa here. 	(0:23:33.14)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Er, I'm already out of time?! 	(0:23:34.19)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Next time: 	(0:23:35.74)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Don't Need Me to Have a Blast. 	(0:23:36.37)
EXTRA : Look forward to it! 	(0:23:38.19)
EXTRA : On this day... 	(0:01:30.57)
EXTRA : ...the sunniest day in autumn... 	(0:01:31.45)
EXTRA : ...athletic festivals are being held all over the country. 	(0:01:33.37)
Soujirou Izumi : Man... 	(0:01:36.20)
Soujirou Izumi : I came to cheer for my daughter... 	(0:01:36.91)
Soujirou Izumi : ...but I didn't expect such a turnout. 	(0:01:38.60)
Soujirou Izumi : This was worth the trip. 	(0:01:40.33)
Soujirou Izumi : I got some great pictures. 	(0:01:42.87)
Soujirou Izumi : Look. 	(0:01:44.75)
Konata Izumi : Otou-san. 	(0:01:45.21)
Soujirou Izumi : Isn't this a great shot? 	(0:01:45.28)
Soujirou Izumi : If you put it like this... 	(0:01:46.69)
Konata Izumi : Which daughter are you talking about? 	(0:01:46.76)
Kagami Hiiragi : Maybe I should cut my hair for the athletic festival. 	(0:01:52.92)
Kagami Hiiragi : Go for a really short look. 	(0:01:55.56)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You're going to cut your hair? 	(0:01:57.76)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : But it took forever to grow it so long. 	(0:01:59.56)
Kagami Hiiragi : I wasn't that serious about it... 	(0:02:03.79)
Konata Izumi : That profound response... 	(0:02:06.17)
Konata Izumi : ...must have something to do with a guy! 	(0:02:08.23)
Kagami Hiiragi : Stop connecting everything to that subject! 	(0:02:09.45)
Kagami Hiiragi : Tsukasa too, stop talking so much! 	(0:02:11.45)
Konata Izumi : But if Kagami cut her hair... 	(0:02:13.19)
Kagami Hiiragi : That's what I heard... 	(0:02:15.03)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...but it's not unusual, right? 	(0:02:17.12)
Konata Izumi : You can't! 	(0:02:18.53)
Konata Izumi : Tsunderes have to have twintails! 	(0:02:19.54)
Kagami Hiiragi : Sorry I have a boring face! 	(0:02:21.96)
Konata Izumi : Oh, yeah. 	(0:02:24.58)
Konata Izumi : The athletic festival's coming up. 	(0:02:25.21)
Konata Izumi : Sounds like a pain. 	(0:02:27.00)
Kagami Hiiragi : Wouldn't expect to hear that from a young person. 	(0:02:28.30)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Kona-chan's good at sports, so she's okay... 	(0:02:30.55)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...but someone like me... 	(0:02:33.22)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...just drags everyone down. 	(0:02:34.97)
Konata Izumi : Don't worry. 	(0:02:36.31)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Onee-chan, what event are you doing? 	(0:02:39.22)
Konata Izumi : Well, it's Kagami, so you know... 	(0:02:42.31)
Konata Izumi : A bread eating contest. 	(0:02:44.68)
Kagami Hiiragi : I've been wondering... 	(0:02:46.18)
Kagami Hiiragi : Are you trying to pick a fight or something? 	(0:02:47.78)
Konata Izumi : So, in the end, what are you going to do, Kagami? 	(0:02:50.02)
Konata Izumi : I guessed right? 	(0:02:57.07)
Konata Izumi : Did I guess right? 	(0:02:58.16)
Kagami Hiiragi : She pisses me off! 	(0:02:59.27)
Kagami Hiiragi : So I plan on doing some independent training for the athletic festival. 	(0:03:00.51)
Kagami Hiiragi : Since fall is for sports. 	(0:03:04.23)
Konata Izumi : But are you really training for the athletic festival? 	(0:03:07.25)
Konata Izumi : Aren't you actually training for the main event afterwards? 	(0:03:10.26)
Kagami Hiiragi : What do you mean? 	(0:03:14.09)
Konata Izumi : You want me to say it? 	(0:03:19.72)
Kagami Hiiragi : She really pisses me off! 	(0:03:20.47)
Kagami Hiiragi : So Miyuki's participating in the inter-class relay. 	(0:03:23.10)
Kagami Hiiragi : Well, I can understand that one. 	(0:03:25.65)
Konata Izumi : She was originally supposed to be in the obstacle course. 	(0:03:26.94)
Nanako Kuroi : Okay. 	(0:03:31.35)
Nanako Kuroi : No more candidates, right? 	(0:03:32.11)
Miyuki Takara : I've never tried it so, I can't wait. 	(0:03:34.40)
Konata Izumi : That's no good, Miyuki-san! 	(0:03:36.70)
Konata Izumi : Your body sticks out too much for an obstacle course. 	(0:03:39.69)
Konata Izumi : You'd have to go through stuff. 	(0:03:43.62)
Konata Izumi : After I said that, she was switched to the relay. 	(0:03:45.70)
Kagami Hiiragi : Isn't that something a middle-aged guy would say? 	(0:03:48.00)
Konata Izumi : Oh, yeah. 	(0:03:51.42)
Konata Izumi : Did you guys ever have a scavenger race in middle school? 	(0:03:51.96)
Kagami Hiiragi : Sure did. 	(0:03:55.96)
Konata Izumi : I was called up once... 	(0:03:57.13)
Konata Izumi : Me? 	(0:03:59.53)
Konata Izumi : ...but he never told me what the criteria were. 	(0:04:01.59)
Kagami Hiiragi : Too many unspeakable things come to mind. 	(0:04:06.77)
Konata Izumi : Well, just ask Miyuki-san when you don't know the answer. 	(0:04:09.60)
Kagami Hiiragi : Don't ask her something like that. 	(0:04:12.82)
Kagami Hiiragi : It's impossible to answer. 	(0:04:14.20)
Kagami Hiiragi : And she really went and asked... 	(0:04:16.15)
Miyuki Takara : A character trait that would come up in a scavenger race... 	(0:04:17.91)
Miyuki Takara : ...that people wouldn't want to tell you about? 	(0:04:20.11)
Miyuki Takara : Perhaps he needed a person with a mole on her face. 	(0:04:25.62)
Miyuki Takara : Some people are sensitive about that. 	(0:04:28.83)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Nothing less from her. 	(0:04:31.08)
Kagami Hiiragi : Nothing less from her. 	(0:04:31.08)
Kagami Hiiragi : Or more like, that was one masterful dodge. 	(0:04:32.76)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Or more like, that was one masterful dodge. 	(0:04:32.76)
Kagami Hiiragi : But I'm pretty sure she's wrong. 	(0:04:34.84)
Miyuki Takara : I enjoy athletic festivals... 	(0:04:39.21)
Miyuki Takara : ...but we have tests right after. 	(0:04:41.51)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Once the festival's over... 	(0:04:43.93)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...there aren't any more events, which is kind of sad. 	(0:04:45.43)
Miyuki Takara : Midterms. 	(0:04:48.73)
Miyuki Takara : Practical exams. 	(0:04:49.48)
Miyuki Takara : Finals. 	(0:04:50.23)
Miyuki Takara : All we have are tests. 	(0:04:51.07)
Konata Izumi : The second semester is a drain on your energy with events like the cultural festival and the athletic festival. 	(0:04:52.69)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Right? 	(0:04:57.66)
Miyuki Takara : Midterms are particularly rough. 	(0:04:58.36)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : They also say that fall is for reading... 	(0:05:02.69)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...so maybe I should read something. 	(0:05:04.83)
Miyuki Takara : It's also a good season to study for tests. 	(0:05:06.58)
Konata Izumi : And there's a whirlwind of new game releases before Christmas! 	(0:05:09.71)
Miyuki Takara : But finals come first. 	(0:05:13.09)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Oh, yeah! 	(0:05:18.88)
Konata Izumi : Oh, yeah! 	(0:05:18.88)
Kagami Hiiragi : You two. 	(0:05:19.30)
Kagami Hiiragi : Could you stop trying to avoid reality? 	(0:05:20.32)
Yui Narumi : I see. 	(0:05:26.51)
Yui Narumi : The athletic festival's coming up, huh? 	(0:05:27.47)
Yui Narumi : You know about the starter's pistol? 	(0:05:29.48)
Yui Narumi : I thought it was a real gun until middle school. 	(0:05:31.56)
Konata Izumi : No way... 	(0:05:34.61)
Yui Narumi : That was when I knew I wanted to be a cop. 	(0:05:35.57)
Konata Izumi : That misunderstanding led to something totally unrelated. 	(0:05:39.41)
Soujirou Izumi : That's right, Konata. 	(0:05:42.94)
Soujirou Izumi : When's the athletic festival at your school? 	(0:05:44.90)
Konata Izumi : This Sunday. 	(0:05:47.66)
Soujirou Izumi : Th-This Sunday?! 	(0:05:50.49)
Soujirou Izumi : Why didn't you tell me such an important thing earlier? 	(0:05:52.42)
Konata Izumi : But we just got the notice today. 	(0:05:55.00)
Soujirou Izumi : There's no time to waste! 	(0:05:57.37)
Yui Narumi : Why's he in such a hurry? 	(0:06:00.79)
Nanako Kuroi : Okay! 	(0:06:02.75)
Nanako Kuroi : Today's the big day! 	(0:06:03.47)
Nanako Kuroi : Show me the fruits of your training! 	(0:06:05.60)
Konata Izumi : Sensei! 	(0:06:08.22)
Konata Izumi : I'm the type who does well without ever training! 	(0:06:09.31)
Nanako Kuroi : Don't say that out loud! 	(0:06:13.11)
Nanako Kuroi : Anyway, you better give it your all in the cavalry race! 	(0:06:14.43)
Nanako Kuroi : The fundamental strategy is to rush in from all sides and whack 'em good! 	(0:06:17.44)
Konata Izumi : So attack from their weak side, right? 	(0:06:20.44)
Miyuki Takara : But we only need to take their hat... 	(0:06:23.82)
Miyuki Takara : Hitting people's kinda... 	(0:06:25.87)
Nanako Kuroi : Don't sweat the little stuff. 	(0:06:27.12)
Nanako Kuroi : That's one of those mistakes of youth. 	(0:06:28.66)
Konata Izumi : So we're just little runts. 	(0:06:31.12)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Onee-chan! 	(0:06:37.66)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Do your best! 	(0:06:38.67)
Miyuki Takara : Good luck! 	(0:06:39.67)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Hey. 	(0:06:43.38)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : How is that anpan attached to the string? 	(0:06:44.05)
Miyuki Takara : It's probably attached to a clip or something. 	(0:06:47.80)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : So you can't take it off very easily. 	(0:06:52.01)
Konata Izumi : Bring us victory! 	(0:06:54.69)
Konata Izumi : Girls must be elegant! 	(0:06:56.60)
Kagami Hiiragi : Like an eating contest could ever be elegant! 	(0:06:58.57)
EXTRA : Ready! 	(0:07:00.86)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : She did it! 	(0:07:11.36)
Konata Izumi : That's Kagamin for you. 	(0:07:18.29)
Miyuki Takara : That person has an incredible camera. 	(0:07:24.75)
Konata Izumi : Man, he's so easy to understand. 	(0:07:32.84)
Kagami Hiiragi : Hey. 	(0:07:35.39)
Kagami Hiiragi : Aren't you in the 100 meter dash next? 	(0:07:36.27)
Konata Izumi : Technically. 	(0:07:38.57)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : How can I learn to run fast like you? 	(0:07:39.78)
Konata Izumi : It's important to visualize. 	(0:07:42.78)
Konata Izumi : Visualize. 	(0:07:45.11)
EXTRA : Ready! 	(0:07:48.78)
EXTRA : Set! 	(0:07:50.86)
Kagami Hiiragi : That's one ancient visualization. 	(0:07:54.07)
Konata Izumi : Goal! 	(0:08:02.33)
Konata Izumi : Like that? 	(0:08:03.88)
Kagami Hiiragi : Are you serious? 	(0:08:04.88)
EXTRA : 3 meters and 25 centimeters. 	(0:08:08.76)
Konata Izumi : So they measure from where your hands reached. 	(0:08:11.09)
Kagami Hiiragi : This is it! 	(0:08:18.56)
Konata Izumi : That's Kagami. 	(0:08:21.98)
Konata Izumi : Dived straight into the sand, huh? 	(0:08:23.36)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : One, two, three. 	(0:08:27.11)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : One, two, three. 	(0:08:29.15)
Miyuki Takara : I've heard that timing your steps is important for hurdles. 	(0:08:30.74)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Steps? 	(0:08:34.54)
Miyuki Takara : One. 	(0:08:36.07)
Miyuki Takara : Two. 	(0:08:36.95)
Miyuki Takara : Three. 	(0:08:37.83)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I get it! 	(0:08:39.34)

Tsukasa Hiiragi : One, three, huh? 	(0:08:48.13)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Um... 	(0:08:50.63)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I started with my right foot so... 	(0:08:51.18)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I don't get it! 	(0:08:55.68)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That was my left foot, so... 	(0:08:57.02)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Three, three, three. 	(0:08:59.64)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Three, two, three... 	(0:09:00.80)
Konata Izumi : She's knocking every single one down. 	(0:09:03.31)

Tsukasa Hiiragi : Yay! 	(0:10:32.65)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Yuki-chan's so cool! 	(0:10:33.74)
Konata Izumi : That's our Miyuki-san. 	(0:10:35.20)
Konata Izumi : Didn't forget to give the spectators some eye candy. 	(0:10:37.24)
Kagami Hiiragi : It's Tsukasa. 	(0:10:49.96)
Kagami Hiiragi : Oh, well. 	(0:10:52.09)
Kagami Hiiragi : H, He, Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Ne... 	(0:10:54.13)
Kagami Hiiragi : Hey! 	(0:11:19.95)
Kagami Hiiragi : Can you do something about that? 	(0:11:20.79)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Sorry. 	(0:11:22.92)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I chose to play the alto part in a quartet for music class... 	(0:11:24.04)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...but my fingers are getting numb. 	(0:11:27.92)
Kagami Hiiragi : Why did you choose the alto part? 	(0:11:31.67)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I-I thought the lower part might be easier. 	(0:11:33.33)
Kagami Hiiragi : Why don't you condition your fingers on an easy song for now? 	(0:11:38.13)
Kagami Hiiragi : You missed most of the notes. 	(0:11:56.73)
Kagami Hiiragi : So try to match me. 	(0:11:59.36)
Kagami Hiiragi : Ready and... 	(0:12:01.70)
Kagami Hiiragi : H-Hold on! 	(0:12:06.91)
Kagami Hiiragi : Play by yourself. 	(0:12:08.29)
Kagami Hiiragi : Seems wrong somehow... 	(0:12:19.05)
Kagami Hiiragi : Try blowing a little softer. 	(0:12:21.10)
Kagami Hiiragi : If you relax, it might go a lot better. 	(0:12:23.68)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I see. 	(0:12:27.22)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Softer... 	(0:12:28.48)
Kagami Hiiragi : That's it. 	(0:12:29.44)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I'll give it a try. 	(0:12:30.85)
Kagami Hiiragi : Isn't she doing more breathing than playing? 	(0:13:00.76)
Kagami Hiiragi : I was thinking we should try the cafeteria occasionally... 	(0:13:06.85)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...but it sure is crowded. 	(0:13:09.48)
Konata Izumi : It's pretty overwhelming. 	(0:13:11.06)
Konata Izumi : And waiting in line is annoying and exhausting. 	(0:13:12.65)
Konata Izumi : Sure sucks. 	(0:13:15.44)
Kagami Hiiragi : Haven't you gotten used to this kind of thing from those events? 	(0:13:16.52)
Konata Izumi : When I'm not eagerly anticipating what awaits me at the end of the line, it sucks. 	(0:13:19.77)
Kagami Hiiragi : True to your desires, huh? 	(0:13:24.03)
Miyuki Takara : That's right. 	(0:13:26.75)
Miyuki Takara : I went to a theme park once... 	(0:13:27.82)
Miyuki Takara : ...and thought that I had lined up for an attraction... 	(0:13:30.00)
Miyuki Takara : ...but the line was for the restroom. 	(0:13:32.67)
Konata Izumi : It's a fundamental rule to check what the line is for first. 	(0:13:34.84)
Miyuki Takara : And I waited two whole hours... 	(0:13:39.04)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I've also gotten in line a few times... 	(0:13:41.63)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...and when it was finally my turn... 	(0:13:43.83)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...the person before me had bought the last one. 	(0:13:45.97)
Konata Izumi : Terrible... 	(0:13:49.19)
Konata Izumi : Don't even wanna picture it. 	(0:13:50.23)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're just unlucky. 	(0:13:51.60)
Miyuki Takara : Look, everyone. 	(0:13:55.39)
Miyuki Takara : What shall we have today? 	(0:13:56.36)
Konata Izumi : Well, I guess I'll go with curry. 	(0:13:58.19)
Konata Izumi : They can't screw it up... 	(0:14:00.11)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'll go with ramen. 	(0:14:01.28)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Me too. 	(0:14:02.91)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I was planning on having miso ramen today. 	(0:14:04.03)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : With lots of corn... 	(0:14:06.66)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...and seaweed, too! 	(0:14:08.04)
Konata Izumi : Kagami's probably having ramen, pudding, and an éclair. 	(0:14:09.78)
Kagami Hiiragi : If I have enough room to eat more. 	(0:14:12.99)
Konata Izumi : You always have more room. 	(0:14:17.96)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What about you, Yuki-chan? 	(0:14:20.67)
Miyuki Takara : I'll have a sandwich. 	(0:14:21.97)
Miyuki Takara : With strawberries. 	(0:14:23.72)
Konata Izumi : Sounds like something you would have. 	(0:14:25.84)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Right? 	(0:14:27.97)
Konata Izumi : By the way... 	(0:14:28.81)
Konata Izumi : Isn't a strawberry sandwich considered dessert? 	(0:14:30.14)
Konata Izumi : Would it count as lunch? 	(0:14:33.23)
Miyuki Takara : Th-That's true... 	(0:14:35.32)
Kagami Hiiragi : You pick some odd issues to be concerned about. 	(0:14:36.69)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What about those chocolate cornets you always have? 	(0:14:39.65)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Wouldn't sweet pastries be considered dessert? 	(0:14:42.24)
Konata Izumi : Stupid Tsukasa, making a comeback. 	(0:14:44.45)
Konata Izumi : Anyway, moving on... 	(0:14:47.55)
Konata Izumi : Unfortunately, Miyuki-san... 	(0:14:49.66)
Konata Izumi : The line for sandwiches is over there. 	(0:14:52.00)
Kagami Hiiragi : Typical behavior. 	(0:14:55.16)
Konata Izumi : Walking is healthy. 	(0:14:56.46)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Look. 	(0:14:59.04)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It's your turn, Kona-chan. 	(0:14:59.59)
Konata Izumi : Curry please. 	(0:15:01.54)
Konata Izumi : With extra sauce. 	(0:15:02.64)
EXTRA : Okay. 	(0:15:03.72)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're pretty shrewd. 	(0:15:04.60)
Konata Izumi : I'll take what I can get. 	(0:15:06.01)
EXTRA : Okay. 	(0:15:10.59)
EXTRA : Next person? 	(0:15:11.05)
Kagami Hiiragi : Soy sauce ramen please. 	(0:15:12.10)
Kagami Hiiragi : With hard noodles. 	(0:15:13.60)
EXTRA : Okay, please wait one moment. 	(0:15:14.90)
EXTRA : Okay. 	(0:15:17.64)

Konata Izumi : I'll go get a table. 	(0:15:21.48)

Tsukasa Hiiragi : Yes. 	(0:15:28.36)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Can I please have miso ramen? 	(0:15:29.12)
EXTRA : Sorry. 	(0:15:31.21)
EXTRA : The last person ordered the last of our noodles. 	(0:15:32.21)

Kagami Hiiragi : Say. 	(0:15:37.33)
Kagami Hiiragi : If you're okay with soy sauce, do you want mine? 	(0:15:38.17)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'm okay with fox udon. 	(0:15:40.42)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Thank you, onee-chan. 	(0:15:42.76)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Hey, onee-chan. 	(0:15:51.22)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You're the older sister because you came out first, right? 	(0:15:53.60)
Kagami Hiiragi : Yeah. 	(0:15:57.40)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I was thinking that it's a good thing I'm the younger sister. 	(0:15:58.35)
Kagami Hiiragi : Why? 	(0:16:01.52)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Because an older sister shouldn't be asking a younger sister for help with homework and stuff. 	(0:16:02.60)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'm pretty sure that copying homework has nothing to do with that. 	(0:16:08.53)
Kagami Hiiragi : Besides, we're twins. 	(0:16:13.07)
Kagami Hiiragi : Neither of us is really older or younger. 	(0:16:14.87)
Kagami Hiiragi : Stop worrying... 	(0:16:16.79)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...and do your homework. 	(0:16:17.71)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : But if I were the older sister... 	(0:16:21.67)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...and all dependable and responsible... 	(0:16:24.63)
Kagami Hiiragi : Onee-chan! 	(0:16:28.00)
Kagami Hiiragi : Show me your homework! 	(0:16:29.39)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Again? 	(0:16:30.97)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You're so hopeless, Kagami. 	(0:16:32.10)
Kagami Hiiragi : Hey. 	(0:16:35.51)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That was too crazy! 	(0:16:36.08)
Kagami Hiiragi : You okay there? 	(0:16:36.50)
Kagami Hiiragi : Get a grip. 	(0:16:37.59)

Konata Izumi : Now I have one more thing to look forward to buying! 	(0:17:01.09)
Konata Izumi : You don't need to praise me so much! 	(0:17:04.05)
Konata Izumi : 1,260 yen... 	(0:17:07.92)
Konata Izumi : ...and 567 yen, huh? 	(0:17:10.05)
Konata Izumi : I'll have enough points after one more book. 	(0:17:13.22)
Konata Izumi : Then I should just get something... 	(0:17:16.70)
Konata Izumi : No. 	(0:17:19.35)
Konata Izumi : Then I'd be falling into their trap. 	(0:17:19.98)
Konata Izumi : I'm not so easy to fool. 	(0:17:21.94)
Konata Izumi : That would be an unplanned purchase for the sake of points. 	(0:17:24.61)
Konata Izumi : That's their strategy. 	(0:17:27.73)
Konata Izumi : I'm not dumb enough to fall for that trick. 	(0:17:30.57)
Konata Izumi : Oh! 	(0:17:34.86)
Konata Izumi : I forgot that the fifth volume was out. 	(0:17:36.62)

EXTRA : I'm sorry. 	(0:18:00.24)
EXTRA : I don't want to let go. 	(0:18:02.06)
Konata Izumi : I thought that only ever happened in manga or games... 	(0:18:03.27)
Konata Izumi : ...but it actually happens in real life. 	(0:18:06.74)
Kagami Hiiragi : Guess so. 	(0:18:08.74)
Konata Izumi : Which means... 	(0:18:10.03)
Konata Izumi : Those two definitely triggered a flag. 	(0:18:11.98)
Kagami Hiiragi : Konata... 	(0:18:14.58)
Kagami Hiiragi : Fantasy refers to the world of illusion. 	(0:18:15.66)

Minoru Shiraishi : And I'm the assistant. 	(0:18:34.88)
Minoru Shiraishi : Shiraishi Minoru. 	(0:18:36.60)
Akira Kogami : We've already reached the eighth episode of this program. 	(0:18:38.18)

Minoru Shiraishi : If we don't come up with some fresh material... 	(0:18:43.69)
Minoru Shiraishi : ...we'll be accused of abusing mannerisms. 	(0:18:45.69)
Akira Kogami : What was that? 	(0:18:47.23)
Minoru Shiraishi : What am I doing?! 	(0:18:49.06)
Minoru Shiraishi : No. 	(0:18:50.98)

Minoru Shiraishi : Was it some salon doing a survey? 	(0:19:00.45)
Akira Kogami : Geez, Shiraishi-san. 	(0:19:01.78)
Akira Kogami : Do you actually mean that? 	(0:19:04.21)

Minoru Shiraishi : Akira-sama. 	(0:19:54.25)
Minoru Shiraishi : Shouldn't we get to today's topic... 	(0:19:55.30)

Akira Kogami : Then we'll decide which figure to make based on your votes! 	(0:20:50.73)
Akira Kogami : Have fun waiting for us to turn the character into a figure! 	(0:20:57.20)
Minoru Shiraishi : Everyone, please vote! 	(0:21:01.45)
Akira Kogami : Okay. 	(0:21:03.86)
Akira Kogami : That's all for today. 	(0:21:04.54)
Minoru Shiraishi : Look forward to next week's Lucky Channel! 	(0:21:06.33)
Akira Kogami : Bye-nee! 	(0:21:08.96)
Akira Kogami : A character from the actual show's obviously gonna win the poll. 	(0:21:12.91)
Akira Kogami : What's with this? 	(0:21:16.55)
Akira Kogami : Like I have a chance in hell. 	(0:21:17.55)
Minoru Shiraishi : No, you can't be sure yet. 	(0:21:18.68)
Minoru Shiraishi : I see. 	(0:21:21.13)
Minoru Shiraishi : They're finally going to make a figure of me. 	(0:21:21.51)
Akira Kogami : What are you talking about? 	(0:21:22.63)
Akira Kogami : This is... 	(0:21:23.60)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That was great, Yuki-chan! 	(0:21:26.12)
Miyuki Takara : Thank you for listening. 	(0:21:28.06)
Kagami Hiiragi : I never expected this side of you. 	(0:21:29.73)
Miyuki Takara : Please... 	(0:21:32.07)
Miyuki Takara : It's embarrassing. 	(0:21:32.94)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Hey, Yuki-chan. 	(0:21:34.47)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Let's sing a song together. 	(0:21:35.88)
Miyuki Takara : Let's do that. 	(0:21:37.73)
Kagami Hiiragi : Sing! Sing! 	(0:21:39.27)
Kagami Hiiragi : A duet, huh? 	(0:21:40.41)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Which song do you know? 	(0:21:41.58)
Miyuki Takara : Let's see... 	(0:21:42.91)
Konata Izumi : Then I'll sing a song while we're waiting. 	(0:21:44.04)
Kagami Hiiragi : There's never gonna be a break, huh?! 	(0:21:46.33)
Konata Izumi : You should also sing! 	(0:21:47.75)
Kagami Hiiragi : What is this? 	(0:21:52.33)
Konata Izumi : Journey to the West. 	(0:21:53.42)
Konata Izumi : Machaaki's Son Goku was great. 	(0:21:54.90)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Huh? 	(0:21:57.51)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Wasn't it Shingo-chan? 	(0:21:58.30)
Konata Izumi : That was the third remake. 	(0:21:59.76)
Konata Izumi : This one ran from 1978 to 1980. 	(0:22:01.76)
Konata Izumi : The original series! 	(0:22:06.02)
Kagami Hiiragi : How old are you?! 	(0:22:08.00)
Kagami Hiiragi : This is a long intro. 	(0:22:11.97)
Konata Izumi : This was when the actors delivered the main narration. 	(0:22:13.57)
Kagami Hiiragi : Like I would know! 	(0:22:17.70)
Konata Izumi : Here it comes! 	(0:22:20.50)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're shouting again?! 	(0:22:23.59)
Konata Izumi : It's in English. Forget that. 	(0:22:50.14)
Kagami Hiiragi : That's it after all this build-up? 	(0:22:52.15)
EXTRA : Well, next time on Lucky Star: 	(0:22:57.02)
Miyuki Takara : Miyuki here. 	(0:22:59.38)
Miyuki Takara : When describing an enormously large object... 	(0:23:00.84)
Miyuki Takara : ...it is described as being Super D-class. 	(0:23:04.74)
Miyuki Takara : The D in this expression... 	(0:23:08.58)
Miyuki Takara : ...was derived from a British ship commissioned in 1906... 	(0:23:10.95)
Miyuki Takara : ...the HMS Dreadnought. 	(0:23:15.17)
Miyuki Takara : In other words... 	(0:23:18.07)
Miyuki Takara : ...something Super D-class... 	(0:23:18.88)
Miyuki Takara : ...would be larger than a dreadnought-class battleship. 	(0:23:20.42)
Miyuki Takara : Well, that was the original meaning... 	(0:23:23.62)
Miyuki Takara : ...but now... 	(0:23:25.95)
Miyuki Takara : ...it's being used in the former context. 	(0:23:27.29)
Miyuki Takara : Next time: 	(0:23:31.96)
Miyuki Takara : That Feeling. 	(0:23:32.88)
EXTRA : Look forward to it! 	(0:23:34.77)
Konata Izumi : Since fall is for reading... 	(0:01:32.75)
Konata Izumi : ...I've been getting my hands on all sorts of books. 	(0:01:34.39)
Kagami Hiiragi : That's unusual. 	(0:01:37.63)
Konata Izumi : Even though it's for an educational purpose... 	(0:01:38.97)
Konata Izumi : ...the expenses are piling up. 	(0:01:40.98)
Kagami Hiiragi : You don't have to buy them. 	(0:01:43.02)
Kagami Hiiragi : Couldn't you just go to a library or something? 	(0:01:44.02)
Kagami Hiiragi : They actually have some stuff you'd want. 	(0:01:46.23)
Konata Izumi : Nah. 	(0:01:48.11)
Konata Izumi : A library wouldn't have manga. 	(0:01:48.78)
Kagami Hiiragi : Reading books, huh... 	(0:01:52.40)
Kagami Hiiragi : Reading BOOKS, huh... 	(0:01:54.61)
Konata Izumi : Can't concentrate... 	(0:01:59.53)
Konata Izumi : Well, you have to take a break every now and then. 	(0:02:10.87)
Konata Izumi : Like this. 	(0:02:13.90)
Konata Izumi : I'll do a little gaming to relax. 	(0:02:15.07)
Konata Izumi : It's Kuroi-sensei. 	(0:02:20.34)
Konata Izumi : Hey! 	(0:02:22.22)
Konata Izumi : Stop playing and get studying! 	(0:02:23.02)
Konata Izumi : I'll be real pissed if your grades are bad. 	(0:02:25.50)
Konata Izumi : Shit! 	(0:02:28.25)
Konata Izumi : The authorities can even find me here! 	(0:02:29.57)
Konata Izumi : Don't do this to me, sensei! 	(0:02:31.28)
Konata Izumi : This game suddenly isn't as fun with all these interruptions. 	(0:02:33.69)
Konata Izumi : How did you study for tests when you were a student? 	(0:02:38.74)
Konata Izumi : Played or slept when I couldn't concentrate. 	(0:02:44.74)
Konata Izumi : Nothing special, really. 	(0:02:46.88)
Konata Izumi : That's the same as me. 	(0:02:49.29)
Konata Izumi : But as an authority figure, I have to be strict. 	(0:02:51.37)
Konata Izumi : I get what she means... 	(0:02:53.56)
Konata Izumi : ...but it still feels unfair! 	(0:02:55.26)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : This time, I plan on setting goals and studying bit by bit. 	(0:02:59.84)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Onee-chan, teach me the stuff I don't get. 	(0:03:03.91)
Kagami Hiiragi : Then let's study together. 	(0:03:06.77)
Kagami Hiiragi : So in this case, x would equal... 	(0:03:12.39)
Kagami Hiiragi : What is it? 	(0:03:16.31)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I just realized that my TV show's about to start. 	(0:03:16.99)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : In today's episode... 	(0:03:20.44)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...a weekly magazine reporter... 	(0:03:21.54)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...spreads word of the main character's pregnancy. 	(0:03:23.50)
Kagami Hiiragi : So you're going to watch TV? 	(0:03:27.33)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It's okay, I'm taping it. 	(0:03:29.62)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Um... 	(0:03:44.13)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I get sleepy whenever there's a bunch of questions I don't get... 	(0:03:47.39)
Kagami Hiiragi : Which means you're always sleepy? 	(0:03:50.31)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I probably shouldn't overexert myself right off the bat... 	(0:03:53.23)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...so I'll call it a day. 	(0:03:55.86)
Kagami Hiiragi : Okay. 	(0:03:57.99)
Kagami Hiiragi : I see you're already losing your willpower. 	(0:03:58.70)
Konata Izumi : I still can't concentrate! 	(0:04:02.78)
Konata Izumi : Okay. 	(0:04:05.70)
Miyuki Takara : You want a trick for studying for a test? 	(0:04:07.41)
Konata Izumi : I was wondering how you study. 	(0:04:09.63)
Miyuki Takara : Let's see... 	(0:04:12.39)
Miyuki Takara : If you concentrate too hard, you'll wear yourself out. 	(0:04:14.05)
Miyuki Takara : In my case, I just follow my usual habits. 	(0:04:17.72)
Konata Izumi : So I'm pretty confident about today's test. 	(0:04:21.46)
Konata Izumi : I feel so enlightened. 	(0:04:24.56)
Kagami Hiiragi : Aren't your usual habits a little risky? 	(0:04:26.39)
Kagami Hiiragi : You don't do anything. 	(0:04:29.28)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : But it's so cute... 	(0:04:31.52)
Konata Izumi : And its claws are venomous. 	(0:04:33.98)
Miyuki Takara : My... 	(0:04:36.53)
Miyuki Takara : So it's actually quite frightening. 	(0:04:37.36)
Kagami Hiiragi : Yo. 	(0:04:40.11)
Konata Izumi : Kagami. 	(0:04:41.69)
Konata Izumi : How'd it go? 	(0:04:42.41)
Kagami Hiiragi : This one was pretty bad. 	(0:04:43.45)
Kagami Hiiragi : Though I maintained my standing. 	(0:04:45.54)
Konata Izumi : So you also do bad sometimes. 	(0:04:47.73)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Because onee-chan helped me out. 	(0:04:49.83)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : As a result, I did better than usual. 	(0:04:52.96)
Kagami Hiiragi : How about you? 	(0:04:55.96)
Konata Izumi : Strangely enough, I did bad. 	(0:04:57.71)
Konata Izumi : And I was so sure I'd do well. 	(0:05:00.63)
Kagami Hiiragi : Nothing strange about it at all. 	(0:05:01.78)
Kagami Hiiragi : It was inevitable. 	(0:05:03.35)
Konata Izumi : But you know... 	(0:05:05.01)
Konata Izumi : ...I was feeling that birds of a feather flock together. 	(0:05:06.18)
Konata Izumi : For example... 	(0:05:09.85)
Konata Izumi : Kagami and Miyuki-san are both class representatives. 	(0:05:10.73)
Konata Izumi : Kagami and I both like games. 	(0:05:14.44)
Kagami Hiiragi : Well, different genres though. 	(0:05:17.21)
Kagami Hiiragi : You play dating sims and RPGs. 	(0:05:19.43)
Kagami Hiiragi : And I play shooters. 	(0:05:21.36)
Konata Izumi : I was thinking that Tsukasa and I were both stupid... 	(0:05:22.91)
Konata Izumi : ...but there was a significant gap this time. 	(0:05:26.54)
Konata Izumi : Well, I'm not really concerned about doing bad. 	(0:05:28.89)
Kagami Hiiragi : Be a little concerned. 	(0:05:32.29)
Kagami Hiiragi : If you slack off because everybody else also did bad... 	(0:05:33.79)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...you'll fall behind. 	(0:05:36.34)
Konata Izumi : Actually... 	(0:05:40.27)
Konata Izumi : I didn't make any bets with otou-san... 	(0:05:41.36)
Konata Izumi : ...so I'm not really angry. 	(0:05:44.30)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're gonna grow up to be a bad person. 	(0:05:46.18)
Kagami Hiiragi : If you're gonna copy Miyuki... 	(0:05:49.05)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...take notes regularly... 	(0:05:50.68)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...instead of waiting till tests are coming up. 	(0:05:52.31)
Konata Izumi : Miyuki-san is really methodical. 	(0:05:54.10)
Konata Izumi : Textbook example of a type A person. 	(0:05:56.48)
Miyuki Takara : Many people have told me that... 	(0:05:59.44)
Miyuki Takara : ...but I'm actually type O. 	(0:06:01.15)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're type O? 	(0:06:03.98)
Kagami Hiiragi : Never would have guessed. 	(0:06:04.91)
Miyuki Takara : However... 	(0:06:06.88)
Miyuki Takara : According to this book... 	(0:06:10.24)
Miyuki Takara : ...I possess many of the qualities... 	(0:06:11.91)
Miyuki Takara : ...characteristic of type O people. 	(0:06:15.00)
Miyuki Takara : For example... 	(0:06:16.92)
Miyuki Takara : It's said that type O people tend to be... 	(0:06:18.67)
Miyuki Takara : ...childish and innocent... 	(0:06:20.97)
Miyuki Takara : ...which describes me perfectly. 	(0:06:22.63)
Konata Izumi : Type O people tend to be pushy and possessive... 	(0:06:24.42)
Konata Izumi : I guess there's another side to Miyuki-san. 	(0:06:29.01)
Kagami Hiiragi : You're probably type A. 	(0:06:31.39)
Konata Izumi : But a lot of people mistake me for a type B. 	(0:06:33.72)
Kagami Hiiragi : Type A people are skilled in social functions and considerate. 	(0:06:36.90)
Kagami Hiiragi : They tend to seek peaceful human interaction? 	(0:06:39.69)
Kagami Hiiragi : Does this even match you? 	(0:06:42.35)
Konata Izumi : I can be really sensitive to the situation. 	(0:06:43.70)
Kagami Hiiragi : Only when it's something you're interested in. 	(0:06:46.32)
Konata Izumi : I'm gentle and attentive to other people. 	(0:06:48.45)
Kagami Hiiragi : When it involves homework. 	(0:06:50.29)
Konata Izumi : What about you, Kagami? 	(0:06:54.45)
Kagami Hiiragi : Me? 	(0:06:56.25)
Kagami Hiiragi : I'm type B. 	(0:06:57.10)
Konata Izumi : So you're laid-back, rude, erratic, unconventional, naive, and insolent, huh? 	(0:06:58.34)
Kagami Hiiragi : What about it? 	(0:07:03.76)
Konata Izumi : Then Tsukasa's type AB? 	(0:07:04.65)
Kagami Hiiragi : What's that supposed to mean? 	(0:07:06.96)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Why? 	(0:07:07.97)
Konata Izumi : Just a hunch. 	(0:07:08.68)
Konata Izumi : If you go by personality... 	(0:07:09.97)
Konata Izumi : ...Tsukasa would be type A... 	(0:07:11.83)
Konata Izumi : ...and Kagami would be type B. 	(0:07:13.02)
Kagami Hiiragi : We're both type B. 	(0:07:15.43)
Kagami Hiiragi : We're twins, remember? 	(0:07:17.65)
Konata Izumi : That's right. 	(0:07:19.27)
Konata Izumi : I forgot. 	(0:07:20.19)
Kagami Hiiragi : And I'm not as laid-back as you are. 	(0:07:21.28)
Miyuki Takara : Speaking of horoscopes... 	(0:07:23.56)
Miyuki Takara : ...I've also heard of ones for animals and sushi. 	(0:07:25.03)
Konata Izumi : Sushi? 	(0:07:28.25)
Konata Izumi : Let's see... 	(0:07:30.94)
Konata Izumi : Miyuki-san is... 	(0:07:31.54)
Kagami Hiiragi : So Miyuki would be salmon roe. 	(0:07:33.61)
Konata Izumi : Still high-class, I see. 	(0:07:34.96)
Miyuki Takara : I love salmon roe! 	(0:07:36.66)
Kagami Hiiragi : And? 	(0:07:38.75)
Kagami Hiiragi : What about Tsukasa and me? 	(0:07:39.25)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Cucumber roll. 	(0:07:43.42)
Konata Izumi : A cucumber roll, huh? 	(0:07:45.04)
Konata Izumi : Well, I guess it counts as sushi. 	(0:07:46.63)
Konata Izumi : This is pretty accurate. 	(0:07:49.01)
Kagami Hiiragi : And what about you? 	(0:07:50.39)
Konata Izumi : Me? 	(0:07:52.10)
Konata Izumi : Sliced ginger? 	(0:07:55.59)
Kagami Hiiragi : It says sliced ginger! 	(0:07:57.97)
Konata Izumi : Don't look down on ginger! 	(0:08:00.68)
Miyuki Takara : Well... 	(0:08:02.23)
Miyuki Takara : You can't have sushi without it... 	(0:08:02.94)
Miyuki Takara : ...and the horoscope's description is positive. 	(0:08:05.32)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : That's true. 	(0:08:09.15)
Kagami Hiiragi : And cucumber rolls count as sushi, right? 	(0:08:10.16)
Kagami Hiiragi : Hello? 	(0:08:15.20)
Kagami Hiiragi : Konata? 	(0:08:15.66)
Kagami Hiiragi : About the blood type conversation today... 	(0:08:16.62)
Kagami Hiiragi : Just to make sure you know... 	(0:08:18.54)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...fraternal twins can have different blood types... 	(0:08:20.08)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...so your guess wasn't wrong. 	(0:08:23.17)
Kagami Hiiragi : You might take me seriously so thought I'd mention it. 	(0:08:25.51)
Konata Izumi : Thanks a lot. 	(0:08:28.09)
Konata Izumi : You're an honest person. 	(0:08:30.59)
Konata Izumi : I'm starting to see the type A in you. 	(0:08:31.93)
Konata Izumi : Oh, yeah... 	(0:08:34.76)
Konata Izumi : There was a psychic reading on TV. 	(0:08:35.39)
Kagami Hiiragi : With those things... 	(0:08:38.95)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...they'll guess right with some people and wrong with others... 	(0:08:40.23)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...so they'd at least make one correct guess. 	(0:08:45.40)
Konata Izumi : Kagami... 	(0:08:49.40)
Konata Izumi : Don't be so pragmatic... 	(0:08:50.61)
Konata Izumi : You'll never have fun in life. 	(0:08:53.08)
Konata Izumi : Act more like your age. 	(0:08:55.12)
Tadao Hiiragi : Tsukasa. 	(0:08:57.95)
Tadao Hiiragi : You worked hard this time. 	(0:08:58.71)
Tadao Hiiragi : Kagami did worse than usual. 	(0:09:02.29)
Tadao Hiiragi : But she still got a higher score, huh... 	(0:09:06.40)
Tadao Hiiragi : Good work, girls. 	(0:09:11.59)
Tadao Hiiragi : How should I put it... 	(0:09:14.55)
Tadao Hiiragi : You did the best you could... 	(0:09:15.60)
Matsuri Hiiragi : Ooh. 	(0:09:17.56)
Matsuri Hiiragi : Tsukasa worked hard. 	(0:09:18.18)
Matsuri Hiiragi : But Kagami still scored higher. 	(0:09:20.26)
Tadao Hiiragi : Hey, Matsuri. 	(0:09:22.56)
Tadao Hiiragi : Can't you be more considerate? 	(0:09:23.77)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Good morning! 	(0:09:28.31)
Kagami Hiiragi : Good morning! 	(0:09:28.31)
EXTRA : Oh, good morning. 	(0:09:29.82)
EXTRA : I envy how the two of you are such fine young ladies. 	(0:09:31.98)
Kagami Hiiragi : Not at all. 	(0:09:35.70)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : You're too kind. 	(0:09:36.16)
EXTRA : To get such wonderful grades at that Ryouou High... 	(0:09:37.16)
EXTRA : I wish my children had a fraction of your ability. 	(0:09:41.08)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It's like... 	(0:09:43.24)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I'm being praised because I'm her sister... 	(0:09:44.29)
Kagami Hiiragi : Nah. 	(0:09:44.71)
Kagami Hiiragi : We aren't that impressive. 	(0:09:45.34)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...so I can't really appreciate it. 	(0:09:47.00)
Kagami Hiiragi : Tests are over. 	(0:09:54.17)
Kagami Hiiragi : Why don't we go all-out and have some fun? 	(0:09:55.24)
Konata Izumi : Sounds good. 	(0:09:57.86)
Kagami Hiiragi : How about watching a movie for once? 	(0:09:58.90)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What's in theaters right now? 	(0:10:01.12)
Konata Izumi : There's a great one right now. 	(0:10:03.10)
Kagami Hiiragi : What is it? 	(0:10:05.04)
Konata Izumi : You could call it a splatter film... 	(0:10:05.71)
Konata Izumi : ...but it still has some psycho-suspenseful, shocking horror elements. 	(0:10:07.46)
Kagami Hiiragi : Then let's do that! 	(0:10:12.34)
Kagami Hiiragi : How about we go home first and meet up later? 	(0:10:13.88)

Konata Izumi : Then I can buy a child's ticket without looking weird. 	(0:10:55.38)
Kagami Hiiragi : Stupid kid. 	(0:10:58.26)
Kagami Hiiragi : She whines about her height all the time... 	(0:10:59.39)

Kagami Hiiragi : What should we have? 	(0:11:12.89)
Konata Izumi : How about a cake buffet? 	(0:11:14.11)
Kagami Hiiragi : Sounds great! 	(0:11:15.83)
Konata Izumi : The buffet... 	(0:11:17.10)
Konata Izumi : A haven for satiating a woman's desires! 	(0:11:18.65)
Kagami Hiiragi : They've got so many cakes and drinks. 	(0:11:22.65)

Kagami Hiiragi : We're almost out of time. 	(0:12:58.58)
Konata Izumi : Oh, Kagami! 	(0:13:03.67)
Konata Izumi : She's on her second wind! 	(0:13:04.93)
Kagami Hiiragi : It'd be a waste otherwise! 	(0:13:06.64)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Impossible. 	(0:13:12.47)
Kagami Hiiragi : No! No! 	(0:13:14.01)
Kagami Hiiragi : If you drink too much water... 	(0:13:15.31)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...you won't be able to eat any more! 	(0:13:17.11)

Kagami Hiiragi : Hurry it up! 	(0:13:42.96)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : This isn't fun... 	(0:13:44.71)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : I can't have fun like this! 	(0:13:46.09)
Kagami Hiiragi : C'mon! Get with it! 	(0:13:46.19)
Konata Izumi : Tests are over... 	(0:13:48.76)
Konata Izumi : ...so I did some hardcore gaming... 	(0:13:50.01)
Konata Izumi : ...which is why I'm so sleepy... 	(0:13:52.74)
Kagami Hiiragi : If you studied that hard... 	(0:13:54.94)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...your tests would have gone differently. 	(0:13:57.10)
Konata Izumi : Recent dating sims have a bunch of save points... 	(0:13:58.64)
Konata Izumi : ...but I can never find a good place to stop. 	(0:14:02.11)
Konata Izumi : I'm the type to do it all in one sitting. 	(0:14:04.65)
Kagami Hiiragi : I've been wondering... 	(0:14:06.68)
Kagami Hiiragi : A student shouldn't be able to buy those. 	(0:14:08.22)
Kagami Hiiragi : How do you buy them? 	(0:14:10.31)
Konata Izumi : I get otou-san to buy them for me. 	(0:14:12.20)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : No way! 	(0:14:14.16)
Kagami Hiiragi : This happens a lot... 	(0:14:14.69)
Kagami Hiiragi : But your family is amazing, in all sorts of ways! 	(0:14:15.81)
Kagami Hiiragi : You actually go buy them, Pops? 	(0:14:17.92)
Kagami Hiiragi : Plus, the daughter shouldn't even be asking! 	(0:14:19.67)
Konata Izumi : So I'm really sleepy. 	(0:14:21.50)
Konata Izumi : You probably don't play games, Miyuki-san. 	(0:14:24.09)
Miyuki Takara : I don't have a game console... 	(0:14:27.50)
Miyuki Takara : ...but I have a computer, so I occasionally play some games. 	(0:14:29.72)
Konata Izumi : What do you play? 	(0:14:32.51)
Konata Izumi : Didn't expect this! 	(0:14:33.97)
Miyuki Takara : Games like Solitaire and Minesweeper. 	(0:14:35.18)
Miyuki Takara : It can get pretty intense. 	(0:14:37.56)
Konata Izumi : They're games... 	(0:14:39.85)
Konata Izumi : ...but you've got it wrong, Miyuki-san. 	(0:14:41.44)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : But I know what you mean. 	(0:14:43.60)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : It's actually easy to get absorbed... 	(0:14:45.28)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : ...in those kinds of simple games. 	(0:14:47.13)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : What kind of scores do you get, Yuki-chan? 	(0:14:49.24)
Miyuki Takara : Luck is a factor in Solitaire... 	(0:14:51.78)
Miyuki Takara : ...but I often score over ten thousand. 	(0:14:53.62)
Miyuki Takara : As for Minesweeper, I completed expert in under one hundred seconds the other day. 	(0:14:56.25)
Konata Izumi : These kind of people really get into this kind of stuff... 	(0:15:01.20)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : There was a lot of sports stuff this year. 	(0:15:07.54)
Miyuki Takara : That one athlete got gold in figure skating at the Winter Olympics. 	(0:15:11.46)
Miyuki Takara : And there was quite a fuss over high school baseball. 	(0:15:15.85)
Miyuki Takara : So many games were going into extra innings! 	(0:15:18.44)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Yup, that Handkerchief Prince. 	(0:15:20.81)
Kagami Hiiragi : Speaking of baseball... 	(0:15:22.43)
Kagami Hiiragi : That one player went to America, right? 	(0:15:23.73)
Konata Izumi : Is the Japan Series already over? 	(0:15:26.60)
Kagami Hiiragi : A long time ago. 	(0:15:28.82)
Konata Izumi : No way! 	(0:15:29.70)
Konata Izumi : Were there any bargain sales? 	(0:15:30.36)
Kagami Hiiragi : This year's Japan Series was between that team and that team... 	(0:15:32.07)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...so there weren't any supermarket or department store chains involved. 	(0:15:35.41)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : But they had a commemorative sale. 	(0:15:38.91)
Konata Izumi : But it was probably just a sale on ham. 	(0:15:43.08)
Tsukasa Hiiragi : Did they do that...? 	(0:15:46.51)
Konata Izumi : Anyway, I need to remember to do a check next year... 	(0:15:48.55)
Kagami Hiiragi : Knowing you... 	(0:15:51.43)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...you're probably just gonna buy snacks. 	(0:15:52.85)
Konata Izumi : I'm not. 	(0:15:54.81)
Konata Izumi : I need stuff like salt, sugar, and soy sauce. 	(0:15:55.93)
Konata Izumi : Those kinds of household staples. 	(0:15:58.35)
Konata Izumi : Well... 	(0:16:01.93)
Konata Izumi : Kagami wouldn't understand what I'm talking about, right? 	(0:16:03.02)
Kagami Hiiragi : Excuse me! 	(0:16:06.53)
Kagami Hiiragi : I know I suck at household chores! 	(0:16:07.86)
Konata Izumi : Eyedrops? 	(0:16:14.24)
Konata Izumi : Want me to help? 	(0:16:15.53)
Miyuki Takara : Thank you so much. 	(0:16:17.49)
Konata Izumi : Okay. 	(0:16:19.16)
Konata Izumi : Lie down. 	(0:16:19.58)
Miyuki Takara : Yes. 	(0:16:21.68)
Konata Izumi : Okay... 	(0:16:22.66)
Konata Izumi : Relax. 	(0:16:23.58)
Miyuki Takara : Y-Yes. 	(0:16:25.29)
Konata Izumi : Then here I go. 	(0:16:26.83)
Miyuki Takara : Okay. 	(0:16:31.59)
Konata Izumi : Relax your muscles. 	(0:16:32.51)
Miyuki Takara : Yes. 	(0:16:33.93)
Miyuki Takara : Um... 	(0:16:39.09)
Miyuki Takara : I'm sorry. 	(0:16:39.89)
Miyuki Takara : I'm not doing this on purpose... 	(0:16:41.02)
Miyuki Takara : Your face... 	(0:16:43.89)
Miyuki Takara : ...scares me! 	(0:16:45.02)
Kagami Hiiragi : With mail-in prize contests... 	(0:16:52.69)
Kagami Hiiragi : ...the problem is how it takes forever to receive the item. 	(0:16:53.99)
Konata Izumi : That's why I came up with a way to fully enjoy these giveaways, Kagamin. 	(0:16:57.32)
Kagami Hiiragi : What's that? 	(0:17:02.50)
Konata Izumi : First, you enjoy the game like you're at a festival. 	(0:17:03.21)
Konata Izumi : Then once the item arrives, you can be happy again, since you've completely forgotten about it. 	(0:17:05.88)
Konata Izumi : Two for the price of one. 	(0:17:10.42)
Kagami Hiiragi : The waiting's what I can't stand... 	(0:17:12.88)
Kagami Hiiragi : But you're infinitely positive about the stuff you enjoy, huh? 	(0:17:16.01)
Akira Kogami : Morning luckies! 	(0:17:24.80)
Akira Kogami : Yes! 	(0:17:26.27)

Akira Kogami : ...is going to say "Hey, Shiraishi. Come here a sec." to... 	(0:17:37.62)
Minoru Shiraishi : Really?! 	(0:17:42.07)
Minoru Shiraishi : I'm Akira-sama's assistant... 	(0:17:43.70)

Akira Kogami : Prop time! 	(0:17:51.83)
Minoru Shiraishi : Roll... 	(0:17:52.88)
Akira Kogami : Are you supposed to be a clumsy, slow turtle? 	(0:17:54.25)
Minoru Shiraishi : Hirag- 	(0:17:56.64)
Minoru Shiraishi : I'm sorry. 	(0:17:58.17)
Akira Kogami : This is finally getting exciting! 	(0:17:59.01)
Minoru Shiraishi : Yes! 	(0:18:01.18)
Minoru Shiraishi : Time to pull up our loincloths... 	(0:18:01.93)
Minoru Shiraishi : ...and do our best! 	(0:18:02.98)
Minoru Shiraishi : Right, Akira-sama? 	(0:18:04.87)
Akira Kogami : Loincloths? 	(0:18:05.94)
Akira Kogami : I'm supposed to be an idol... 	(0:18:07.97)
Akira Kogami : ...so that stuff's kinda... 	(0:18:10.11)
Akira Kogami : You handle it. 	(0:18:12.23)
Minoru Shiraishi : That's right... 	(0:18:14.48)
Minoru Shiraishi : Uh... 	(0:18:16.32)
Minoru Shiraishi : When you pull a loincloth up so tight that it gets pinched... 	(0:18:18.23)
Akira Kogami : Hey. 	(0:18:20.82)
Akira Kogami : I'd like to warn you out of concern. 	(0:18:21.70)
Minoru Shiraishi : C-Concern...? 	(0:18:23.95)
Akira Kogami : Once an entertainer gets in the gutter... 	(0:18:25.58)
Akira Kogami : ...it's over. 	(0:18:27.42)
Minoru Shiraishi : So I'm an entertainer... 	(0:18:28.50)

Minoru Shiraishi : Minorun-run! 	(0:18:43.68)
Akira Kogami : Right? 	(0:18:45.31)
Minoru Shiraishi : You can say that? 	(0:18:46.64)
Akira Kogami : What do you think? 	(0:18:48.15)
Akira Kogami : She reminds me of one of those old idol characters. 	(0:18:48.94)
Minoru Shiraishi : Uh, you think so? 	(0:18:51.86)
Minoru Shiraishi : Well, I guess you could say she gives off some idol vibes... 	(0:18:54.49)
Akira Kogami : Don't make me laugh! 	(0:18:58.94)
Akira Kogami : Hiiragi Tsukasa's an idol? 	(0:19:00.86)
Minoru Shiraishi : Where did that come from? 	(0:19:03.16)
Akira Kogami : Y'know... 	(0:19:04.54)
Akira Kogami : You're working with me here. 	(0:19:05.91)
Akira Kogami : Learn what a true idol is about already. 	(0:19:08.00)
Minoru Shiraishi : Y-Yes. 	(0:19:10.46)
Akira Kogami : Hiiragi Tsukasa is merely a soothing character... 	(0:19:11.84)
Akira Kogami : ...with a loser's face. 	(0:19:14.55)
Minoru Shiraishi : A loser's face, huh... 	(0:19:18.34)
Akira Kogami : Anyway... 	(0:19:20.89)
Akira Kogami : ...who gives a damn about Tsukasa? 	(0:19:21.53)
Minoru Shiraishi : Not even Pops ever hit me! 	(0:19:21.76)
Akira Kogami : I'll teach you the basics of an idol right now. 	(0:19:23.67)
Akira Kogami : First is the method for having pictures taken. 	(0:19:27.81)
Akira Kogami : Now look here. 	(0:19:30.35)
Akira Kogami : This will be a useful lesson for you. 	(0:19:31.31)
Akira Kogami : So put some back into it. 	(0:19:34.53)
Minoru Shiraishi : Yes! 	(0:19:36.36)
Akira Kogami : You know how people suddenly take pictures when you're in the city? 	(0:19:36.94)
Akira Kogami : Come on. 	(0:19:40.94)
Akira Kogami : Press the shutter. 	(0:19:41.53)
Minoru Shiraishi : Looking like a loser...? 	(0:19:42.62)
Akira Kogami : Yeah. 	(0:19:46.33)
Akira Kogami : Like that. 	(0:19:47.04)
Akira Kogami : Props are also important. 	(0:19:48.71)
Akira Kogami : You should always carry them around. 	(0:19:51.25)
Minoru Shiraishi : How? 	(0:19:53.29)
Akira Kogami : And you won't want to be caught off guard when you're walking around... 	(0:19:53.92)
Akira Kogami : ...so always be attentive. 	(0:19:59.43)
Akira Kogami : And... 	(0:20:01.09)
Akira Kogami : ...make sure you have sparkling white teeth. 	(0:20:01.80)
Akira Kogami : Like a doll! 	(0:20:03.76)
Minoru Shiraishi : Intense. 	(0:20:04.81)
Akira Kogami : And then... 	(0:20:05.87)
Akira Kogami : ...make sure your eyes are all wide like goggles... 	(0:20:06.56)
Akira Kogami : ...and only smile with these muscles. 	(0:20:09.02)
Minoru Shiraishi : Scary! 	(0:20:11.06)
Akira Kogami : And you want a natural expression. 	(0:20:11.81)
Akira Kogami : Like if someone suddenly turns a camera on you... 	(0:20:14.73)
Akira Kogami : Akira's, surprised! 	(0:20:18.03)
Akira Kogami : Like that. 	(0:20:20.28)
Minoru Shiraishi : Natural, you say... 	(0:20:22.69)
Akira Kogami : Also, as a variation... 	(0:20:24.22)
Akira Kogami : ...if you're going with a guy into a ho— 	(0:20:26.56)
Akira Kogami : Oh, no! 	(0:20:27.86)
Akira Kogami : It's time to say goodbye! 	(0:20:29.25)
Akira Kogami : So, in this segment, send us any questions and praise for me... 	(0:20:31.00)

Akira Kogami : We also accept submissions on the radio or our homepage! 	(0:20:39.47)
Minoru Shiraishi : Okay! 	(0:20:41.88)
Minoru Shiraishi : Then look forward to next week. 	(0:20:42.34)
Akira Kogami : Bye-nee! 	(0:20:44.09)
Akira Kogami : We had a photo shoot, right? 	(0:20:46.84)
Minoru Shiraishi : Yes, we did. 	(0:20:48.89)
